Lisa F,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Never thought I’d say this, but this is better than a physical books!","I charge my kindle once every 8 weeks at around 30% from a full charge. I don’t like to keep it in airplane mode so if I turned that on i could probably get 10 weeks.  Battery life is shockingly good!Touch screen: is fine… not great but that’s to be expected with an e-ink tablet. Highlighting can be awkward at times, but I just being nit picky.I’ve never needed the waterproof feature, but it’s nice to have it.The built in light is AMAZING! I schedule the warm light feature past 8pm, usually set to warmth 23. Brightness is usually set to 8 and it is perfect. I read this before bed every night and it helps me wind down, doesn’t strain my eyes, and is so convenient.The kindle is the perfect size and you can take it anywhere.I thought only 8GB of storage would be an issue, but was pleasantly surprised. I rarely have more than 15 books on it at once, and I’ve only used a tiny amount. You could easily store hundreds of books at once on this but since it downloads them so quickly and saves all of your notes and highlights, there’s no need. If you’re on a budget, 8GB is plenty, trust me.Notes and highlights are amazing… I like reading nonfiction and it is SO handy to sync with my goodreads account and have every highlight I’ve ever made in any book stored on there for me. I’m able to get the important things out of the books and just reread my highlights.I’ve only played an audiobook from my kindle once, but it worked great. All you need is a Bluetooth speaker, and it will automatically sync your progress for when you go back to visually reading.Lock Screen ads are not that bad, I don’t think it’s worth the $20 to remove. They never interrupt your story, they only show when you put the kindle to sleep and if you have a cover like I do you will barely notice they’re there.It is super comfortable to read in whatever position you find most comfortable. For example, I like reading in bed on my side. With a physical book this is awkward and uncomfortable but with a kindle it’s no problem. Everything is so customizable: I changed my font and text size to something that suits me better.Something about reading on a screen gets you hooked, only without the distractions. I don’t know how to explain it, but it keeps me hooked on my books.Also, being able to check my streak on my phone keeps me motivated.TLDR: I am reading wayyyy more with the kindle than I did with physical books, 10/10 would recommend."
L. Atkeson,2.0 out of 5 stars,The Damn thing has ADDS!  A $175 git ADDS!!,I am going to buy a Kobo soon.
roger bass jr,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love my kindle,"Love it, great battery life and access to so many books!! Also for the price you just can’t beat it!!"
George Gibbs,2.0 out of 5 stars,These things don't last very long.,"I really like this when it works, but it only works for about a year.  This is the 6th one I have bought in the last several years."
Meg West,4.0 out of 5 stars,Why is the power button on the bottom?????,"I have used and loved Kindles since the first edition, and have used my current Paperlight for at least 4 years.  The waterproof feature is key, as I am a poolside and shower reader. I have never fully dropped my current kindle, but have certainly gotten it quite wet, with no ill effect. I’m considering a new mode because the charging port is finally getting wonky.Since this device has come out, I have had one major issue with the design. Why is there a protruding power button on the bottom of the darn thing??? Without a cover, there is basically no sensible way to hold the device without one of your fingers toggling the power button. Notice that the pictures show users barely gripping one corner, like maniacs. There’s no way to turn the page from that position, and it will quickly wear out your hands and arms, especially if you have small hands.And when you go to prop up the kindle so that you can read it hands free while doing other things, you have to create a perfect little hole for the button or it keeps turning on and off. A case helps, but personally I trust the waterproofing of the kindle much more than the case so I often remove it.The reason I find this so annoying is that in so many says the Kindle is a super well designed device that allows for frictionless reading an an experience similar to or superior to paper. But after all that work, it’s like no one on the design team ever actually used the thing, or considered how actual users hold their devices.Apparently the Paperwhite Signature has a side power button. I’m afraid this may just be a plot to extract that extra $50 from me :)"
k.,3.0 out of 5 stars,not what i was expecting!,"paper white kindle. i don't understand why people are so crazy about this thing...i was not expecting it to be so basic.i was expecting it to be much more sophisticated than this.it's not in color. black white grey only.it's not easy to use.i don't know about other people, but storing 2000 digital books(or whatever the high number is)is a bit of an odd idea.i keep books.i love books.i've always been a voracious reader...tho i can't imagine buying and keeping digital books on this thing.for 120+$ one would think that there would be a lot of incredible features...(considering that for another 150- 180 you can get an ipad)there is access to the web browser but it's nothing anyone would want to depend on if it was truly needed.i don't like giving negative feedback about anything really... i just don't use it if i don't want it.i just think Amazon, Especially Amazon, could make this a lot more than it is for not that much more cost to then & give the product users something special. this is rudimentary at best. it's slow unattractive feels flimsy/not substantial.that's what i think.i want amazon to understand that this isn't acceptable. for 40$? yes.for 120$+? no way."
Jelita Aldrich,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Just buy the 8GB + no ads, it’s worth it","So far loving my kindle so much! I bought it during the prime day event and saved a lot more money. It’s been perfect for travel, reading in low light, carrying your entire library with you anywhere. It’s so lightweight. A single charge can last me more than a week if I’m reading a couple hours a night or 5ish days if I’m reading heavily throughout the day everyday. It also charges extremely fast. The books on there are much cheaper than in store. I also love that you can hold down on a word to get the definition of it.I DO recommend paying to get it without ads so you can avoid embarrassing ones like the one pictured above. I thought maybe the ads would eventually learn the kind of books I like to read but it didn’t and it was just such an eyesore. But tbh I could only last a week with ads on so maybe eventually it would give you better recommendations? But if you do decide to buy with ads and get sick of it later, know that you CAN still pay to remove ads through your Amazon account but it is like $20 which sucks but imo worth it. Now I can just see the cover of the book I’m reading and it’s so much nicer.I bought 16GB but I saw on Reddit later that 8GB can still hold thousands of books so 16 is pretty unnecessary/excessive, so save your money there.I do recommend getting some kind of case (I bought a clear one so I can still see the Agave green) because it does help with gripping the kindle better.I was hesitant to buy because I didn’t really want to look at yet another screen at the end of the day but it’s very soft on your eyes and you can adjust brightness/warmth and even have it do that for you automatically based on the time of day. I’ve read it in both bright day light and pitch black room and haven’t felt any eye irritation or head aches from it.All in all, I think the kindle has been my best purchase of the year and I’m getting a TON of use out of it because I can skip the trip to the library and keep on reading. My only qualm is that the interface is a teensy bit slow to respond, but it hasn’t been that much of an issue or annoyance."
Dp,2.0 out of 5 stars,Pixel issue,"Called customer service, replacement provided.  Customer service please contact me for resolution to this issue of original Kindle Paperwhite.  My first review was rejected."
Michael Black,1.0 out of 5 stars,Pointless Product,I feel like I was scammed purchasing this product. You can’t download books from the library and are forced to pay for them through kindle. The fire is cheaper and able to download apps. I wish I could return.
Janet K.,5.0 out of 5 stars,A wonderful welcome back to reading,I bought this Kindle for my Birthday and I just love it.  I’ve been an avid reader all my life but I have gotten away from reading due to lack of storage space and also no close library.  This has been the perfect solution to the problem.  It’s small and comfortable for my hands and very user friendly.  The battery life is great and the options of brightness and size of text are perfect.  A really great purchace.
Kimberly,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for travel and night reading.,"I will always love physical book copies, but the Kindle Paperwhite is a close second. It’s small and easy to bring with you, and is much nicer on the eyes when reading with low light."
CWDesign,2.0 out of 5 stars,dislike black frame around page,I have put off getting a new kindle and have still been using my old 6 year  paperwhite.  It is white and I really wish I could get another white one!  I reluctantly ordered a green one and it is a drab unattractive color and on the page side it has a black face which makes for a black frame around the page.  I hate that. A book page does not have a black frame around it so why does this thing have to be this way.  I may send it back haven't decided yet.
Rita,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love My New Kindle,My old one died so I got this one which is a bit bigger plus has a light. It's awesome!
galpal,1.0 out of 5 stars,BEWARE OF WARRANTEE RETURNS!,"I purchased this in 8/23 (it’s now 11/23). I also purchased the 2 year warrantee. It was not working properly, multiple issues but mainly would not accept updates and would lock up and lose settings.  I called and they sent me another unit. What they sent me was a RECONDITIONED unit. Not a new one. So basically I have to just cross my fingers and hope I did not just inherit someone else’s issues.  It’s not right.  I had purchased a new unit an extremely short time ago. It should have been replaced with a new unit.  I was told warrantee stated any replacements would be reconditioned. It’s not right."
Karen Lee,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great adjustments now,Had a Paperwhite from 5 years ago. This one is so much better with “lighting” adjustments to make it easier to read at night. Highly recommend
Bryan S,2.0 out of 5 stars,Paperweight maybe more fitting,"A little more than a year and lines have formed on the screen. Well cared for but screen failure from normal use is unacceptable, no more kindles in our house."
Calif guy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great reader,"I love my Paperwrite.  I use it every day.  Light weight, perfect size, best way to read a book there is from my pov."
Chieftech,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reading Everywhere!,"Love the Kindle! I can take my reading everywhere I go! The battery lasts forever, its light, and it's just the right size. The touch screen is a bit sensitive though so I have issues with scrolling too far or with backing out to the home screen at times. Overall a fantastic product and great value."
Adrianna Francis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Charge lasts forever!,"This product is amazing, I got it as a gift in the beginning of the year and have only had to charge it 2 times, I’ve read 16+ books on it so far. Love that it has a “night” feature, making it easier to read while I’m in my kids rooms waiting for them to fall asleep instead of mindless scrolling on my phone. Love that when purchasing books it then gives you recommendations on what you might like to read next based off your previous books read. Also you’re able to download books from the libby app if you have a library card and read them on the kindle! It was a little confusing to figure out how to do that initially but overall is very user friendly. Lightweight. Charge lasts forever. 10/10 recommend."
Felipe,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent,All very well
Fair Oaks,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not as great as hoped on battery life.,"I admit, I read a lot, usually a couple hours a day and the battery is only good for about a week or so. I do turn the wireless off but I expected more than what my older kindle could do."
Grace B,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love my kindle!,"I love that I can read without the light on, change the text size so I don’t need to wear my reading glasses, and can read outside with no glare.  It fits in my purse so I can take with me anywhere."
vanessa,5.0 out of 5 stars,love my kindle!!,"i love my kindle so much, i bring it everywhere with me. the battery life is amazing, i hardly ever need to charge it. i put a white decal on my kindle, but i wish it came in white!! otherwise im very happy with it and recommend it to everyone that loves reading."
Garden Girl,4.0 out of 5 stars,not the best battery,This is my 4th kindle and my 2nd paperwhite.  I do not find the battery life lives up to the hype.  I'm doing well when mine lasts a week.  Kind of disappointing.
Ana Garcia 92,5.0 out of 5 stars,superb,I love how easy it is to use and how practical it is.
katherine sue mooney,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love it,📖
Janet T.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Kindle Paperwhite. A great investment!,I love Kindle's. This is my second Paperwhite and third Kindle. Love to be able to take and read anywhere.
Miranda Essig,5.0 out of 5 stars,Should have bought a long time ago!,"Battery life is amazing. The natural light doesn't hurt my eyes or give me headaches. I had tried a different ereader in the past, but it gave me horrible headaches due to the harsh light and tiny fonts. I am so glad that I decided to try the kindle paperwhite. I should have bought one a long time ago!"
MARY T.,5.0 out of 5 stars,KINDLE.,"I JUST LOVE MY KINDLE.  IT IS GREAT, WISH I HAD GOT IT SOONER,  I AM SO HAPPY WITH IT AND I AM NOT ACCUMULATING BOOKS ALL OVER MY HOUSE,  VERY HAPPY WITH IT."
Amber S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,This is my first e-reader and I love it! The screen light is not bright like a phone or tablet so that it strains my eyes and I love that there's no glare on it when I take it outside. I connect mine to the Libby app and can send books directly from my library straight to the Kindle which is awesome. Plus it charges pretty fast and stays charged for a long time.
Cody Knight,5.0 out of 5 stars,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE","I love my kindle! I had the fire for several years,  but it eventually died.  I got the paperwhite,  and I am obsessed.  I read so much worth it because it is easier to carry around than a book. The display is stunning.  The performance is fantastic.  I hardly ever have to charge it,  and I read all day and everyday! You cannot go wrong with this product."
Kadilello,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect in every way,Love my easy to hold compact paperwhite!  I take it everywhere for reading made easy
Charles B.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Kindle review,I really enjoy the Kindle Paper-white and all of its features.I also enjoy the case I purchased for it as well.
Francine Enea,1.0 out of 5 stars,Defective Kindle,I have a defective kindle. The pages continue to bounce forward several pages or back several chapter. It also turns itself of about every twenty minutes. May I get it replaced? If so how would I do that?
chandra,5.0 out of 5 stars,Loves it,Love my kindle
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Poor power button placement for my use (bottom of kindle),I actually love my kindle but I'm not sure much thought was put into the power button placement. I hit this constantly. The kindle is light but sometimes I just want to rest it on a table or airplane tray and not have to hold it up but can't really do that without sending it to sleep.
Kindle Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of Money,My sister was so excited to get this for me as a gift. I can't stand the way it turns from page to page it Scrolls up not side to side. When you do scroll you get this funny little lighting that looks like a x-ray. Can't get the light adjusted to read the pages right. The size is awkward and the case she bought for it doesn't work. I love my sister so I'm going to keep the thing and use it when I'm in the boat. Hopefully it won't fall overboard. Never owned to Kindle reader before and certainly will never buy one after my experience with this one. It's truly a pain in the butt to go to the settings because every time you exit it takes you back to the page you were reading and I would just like to go to home screen and know when I turn it off it's off.
Amy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best ever!,Y’all this was by far my best and favorite purchase ever! It was perfect to read on at the beach. I love it.
Bookworm,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not Worth It,"I’m a frequent user of the Kindle app and I was recently gifted the Kindle paperwhite as a present. Since I have set up my kindle, my main issue is that it has not once synced up with my Kindle app."
Jeffrey Dong,1.0 out of 5 stars,replacement/refund policy is a disaster,"Kindle stopped working. Had to jump through many hoops just to get to replacement/refund department. Sent it in eight weeks ago and they acknowledged receiving it. No replacement, no refund, no word at all. Finally jumped through more hoops and they are refunding purchase, even though it was suppose to be a replacement. What a disaster of an experience."
Cameron,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best purchase I've made.,This is definitely the best thing I've bought myself this year. The one thing that I was hesitant about was the display. I thought it would be like reading off of a smartphone. It's not. Not even close. It looks just like a printed page. One thing I love about it is that it's super easy to send documents from my computer to read on the device. Five stars. Easy recommendation.
Evan Logue,3.0 out of 5 stars,Downsides,"I wanted a kindle that would outwardly show my children that I am enjoying reading. So I often read on my Kindle app on my phone when I’m away from home. My main gripe is that my Kindle doesn't syncs with my phone app. Secondly, the this particular Kindle is glitchy and makes scrolling difficult."
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Battery life,It has a amazing battery life I got the Wednesday Nov 1st and have been reading nonstop every day and I'm still at 70 %
MAL,5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE everything about my new kindle!!!!,"It is a compact library that you can take anywhere!! I LOVE the kindle paperwhite!!! It is so compact and light weight. I can carry it around in my purse.I ABSOLUTELY did get a cover for it, but I needed that so I could quickly find it."
Pat J,1.0 out of 5 stars,stopped working in less than a year and will not replace,Kindle stopped working less that a year after purchase.  Amazon only overing tips to fit but not replacement as stated was possible.
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my Kindle Paperwhite!,"I love my Kindle Paperwhite! I'm normally a hard copy of a book kind of reader. I like the feel of the book and like to flip back to something I want to see again. I've fallen in love with my Kindle. It's so easy, I can take it on trips, and I can read with the lights out, if I want to read before fallling asleep. The battery, so far, seems to last a long time. The only thing I would say negative is just because I've not figured out how to use it. It's been confusing trying to get to know how to get to the different windows. I have the Kindle Unlimited, too, and I think it's worth it if you read a lot. I didn't understand how it worked so I'll give a brief explanation. It's sort of like a library that you can check out a certain amount of books from at a time. When you're at your limit, you have to turn in one before getting another. You do not own the books in Kindle Unlimited unless you purchase them. I would definitely buy the Paperwhite again, or give it as a gift."
Gladys Wolfe,5.0 out of 5 stars,I gave all my paper books away!,"Being old school I was not sure if I would like a kindle but decided to give it a try.  I have read so many more books since purchasing this!  It easily fits into my small handbag so take it everywhere with me and I can read while waiting for a doctor or other appointment.  I can take it to the beach and easily read it out in the sun… and it’s so easy to just hold in one hand, to turn the page and the batter last forever!  I have since cleaned out my book shelf and donated all my hard cover and paperback books.  No turning back for me."
courtney walters,5.0 out of 5 stars,In love!,Absolutely in love with my kindle and I even got it on sale!
Margie.P,2.0 out of 5 stars,Don't waste your money,"I got this case because of the color! Loved it at first, but after a few months the edges started coming apart! Reached out to Amazon but they didn’t want to replace the item since the return window had ended. For the price I expected it to last at least a year. So overall very disappointed in the durability of the case. I should have just bought a cheaper version had I known it was going to start peeling/tearing like that."
patrick tomkins,5.0 out of 5 stars,Totally worth the upgrade!,"My 2019 model Kindle Paperwhite stopped connecting to the internet, very frustrating. But I figured I needed to upgrade anyway, and this model was so worth it. Lighting is much better and  the larger size is wonderful. The screen is much more responsive too. If you're on the fence about upgrading, take the plunge, this is a great product."
Cris,1.0 out of 5 stars,299 ppi,"I took my Kindle Paperwhite out of the box for the first time and everything was perfect. When I turned it on, I saw a small white dot on the screen and I thought it was a particle of dust or dirt, I cleaned it with a microfiber cloth so as not to scratch the screen and it DIDN'T work. It was clear that this was a damaged pixel. Annoying because being a new product, it is expected to come without flaws, no matter how small they are. And it's even more annoying when reading because that pixel shines on its own, it's not due to the brightness of the screen. I wanted to contact customer service before the review, but I was opening an old chat and after 3 more attempts, it showed me an error message. I wanted to contact customer service before the review, but I was opening an old chat and after 3 more attempts, it showed me an error message. I attach photos of the screen off, on and dark mode."
JamJat,1.0 out of 5 stars,easy access,"IEither this kindle is not working right or it is not like the fire I returned,  Can I speak with someone or do you have a store I can go to for help"
stephen,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy start up,Everything went smoothly and didn’t have any problems going from my previous Kindle to the new one.
Christina DeLeon,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Booknerds Bible,"I got this as a gift from my husband because well books are super expensive. This has become my emotional support kindle now. It goes wherever I go. So far I have used my Kindle unlimited subscription, and I have bought eight books with tons of room on that bad boy to still spare. The screen also looks more like a physical book than a The screen also looks more like a physical book than a tablet. I also only have to charge this, maybe once every two weeks. Don’t think twice about this purchase, just get it! ( I still buy books. I just buy them on my Kindle first, and if I really like them, I’ll buy the physical book)"
Chris Bobb,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best friends + Kindle Girlies = Best Weekend Ever,I really wanted a kindle this year for my birthday after seeing everyone else on TikTok ordering them. I jumped on the hype and ended up grabbing me and my best friend one. I couldn’t wait to give hers to her on Christmas but to say she was beyond excited is an understatement. We’re hoping she’ll have a quiet winter relaxing reading everything she can get her hands on!
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"KINDLE PAPERWHITE, USED OPTION","Nice machine~ I found one lightly scratched on the front screen, but the photo is hard to show it, so I bought a screen protector to cover it. It has a few marks on the backside, but it is a competitive price. bring it with my travel trip is quite great~ overall, recommend it."
Maggie O.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Worth it for those who love the experience of reading,"I touted on for ages how I was a ""true"" reader who wanted a physical book in my hand, the smell of the paper, turning pages, yada yada. And I still do enjoy all of those factors to physical reading, everyone does. But after actually experiencing using an e-reader I can say with certainty that I prefer reading with my kindle over a paper book now. Are you reading for the experience of the stories or are you trying to prove a point with your reading? That's really the difference here.First and foremost, using my kindle is so much more comfortable in every aspect. I do most of my reading before bed and having the screen backlit with adjustable brightness and warmth is a game changer, and the screen really does view/read the same as paper. (I tried reading off my tablet before dishing out the money for a kindle and the eye strain is nonexistent compared to a tablet. There's also no screen glare which is something super annoying about reading on a tablet in the sunlight.) That alone makes it a win compared to trying to balance a little clip-on light on my books.I also read a lot of fantasy and romance, and the books just seem to keep getting longer. Hefting around a 500+ page book is annoying. It's heavy to hold and bulky. Trying to hold your page can be irritating. It's nearly impossible to prop up a bigger book and read if you're not using your hands. A kindle changes all of that. It's crazy lightweight and thin. You can prop it on a stand if you're eating. You can carry thousands of books for a tiny fraction of the space and weight of a paper book. Your whole library can be at your disposal at any time, so if you catch yourself bored with what you're reading or finishing your current read, you can instantly start on the next without planning ahead.And there's just the ease of acquiring your books. Did your book end on a cliffhanger and you're ravenous to know what happens next? Two minutes later that baby's downloaded and you're ready to read again. E-books are also typically less money than the physical counterparts. If you use the included kindle unlimited you're even better off. Like I said, I'm a romance reader and the fact of the matter is I pick up a lot of trashy books that I'm happy don't take up room in my home and that I didn't pay much, if any, for.I think the bonuses of a kindle that I wasn't even expecting are the actual abilities. I never used to notate my physical books. I know a lot of people do, but I have always been someone who wants them to stay in as good a shape as possible, and I also don't need people reading my intimate feelings and thoughts when they want to borrow my copy of something. The kindle allows you to highlight passages (in multiple colors), bookmark pages, make notes. Now I have my own system of appreciating books in a way I never allowed myself before, as well as easily finding passages I loved or want to refer to again. There are also dictionary and translation functions if you don't know the context of something, which is such a simple but appreciated feature I didn't know I needed. And of course you can customize font, size, and layout to fit your personal preferences.The kindle is waterproof which will be wonderful for poolside or bathtub reading, as well as just general clumsiness. And while I don't believe the battery is quite as good as they claim, it does last an impressive amount of time, even with regular daily reading. This is especially nice because I like to carry it with me in my purse and have yet to worry about it dying before I want it to.My one complaint and the reason for four stars is I do feel like they're pricey for what they are, and only suggest buying on sale (they happen often enough on amazon it should never be a long wait). The processing system is irritatingly slow sometimes. When you're trying to scroll through the store the lag can be an eye twitch, and every now and then it'll jump multiple pages. You can buy a tablet for the same price if not cheaper and have more function and a faster output. I really believe though if you're an avid reader there's no denying what a kindle offers you compared to a tablet. I almost hate saying that, but it's true. A kindle is truly meant for reading; I'd buy another if this one went kaput tomorrow. But I won't lie, if you're only an occasional reader? You enjoy a best-selling novel here and there but mainly prefer tv or whatever else to fill your downtime? Maybe not worth the money for you! That's your own financial consideration.Last but not least, some tips when you're buying. DO get the version with ads. I don't even know if I'd consider them ads, they only show up when you're not using the device, and they're literally just like a pic of a book and maybe a quote. It's not like an irritating pop up you'd see online. It's totally noninvasive, to the point where I wouldn't even be bothered to try and get rid of them for free... I barely even realize they're there. Also take advantage of the included kindle unlimited! There are a ton of great reads on there if you're willing to look. If you want to cancel after the trial go for it, but it's worth perusing while it's offered. Three months included is a good deal. Honestly I also think it's worth it if you are someone who goes through phases with really specific niche tropes... power through seven mafia romance novels+ for the price of what you'd pay for one, LOL.I know this is a ridiculously long review, but I'm emotionally attached to my kindle in a way I did not expect. It goes everywhere with me and provides me all the convenience and comfort I need as a reader. If you want to go on about the pleasures of paper pages, by all means! But if you're curious about the kindle and why someone would want it, here we are. I used to think part of the romance of reading was the book itself... you never know better 'til you know better."
Tatiyana Renfroe,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love my kindle,This is my favorite thing to read on. something I use everyday.
Mthroesch,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great purchase,"It took me a long time to decide to make this purchase. I read a lot but either read an actual book or on the kindle app on my phone or tablet. So I couldn't imagine I needed something else BUT it is great. It was hard for me to read an actual book in bed at night because of a bed partner and needing light. Reading on my phone is inconvenient because it runs down my battery and the screen isn't very big. Then the tablet worked but it is heavy, battery runs down fast, hard to read outside in the sun because the lighting. I bought the Kindle and oh my gosh how great it is. It is light weight, battery last forever, I can read well in low light or bright light. If your on the fence.....YES it's worth it and you need it."
Valeria Long,5.0 out of 5 stars,An upgrade.,My older Kindle died. This is nice as it's brighter & has a longer battery life. I read quite a lot & this suits my needs.
CincyBearcatFan,3.0 out of 5 stars,Loved to read,"I ordered 2 Kindles from this past Amazon Prime Days. I thought I had ordered both with “first 3 months free Kindle Unlimited”, but evidently I received only one with that feature. Can’t find out how to remedy this problem."
Randy F.,2.0 out of 5 stars,Slow and Clunky,Compared to a tablet the Kindle Paperwhite O/S is old and outdated.  The swiping is clunky.  Worst of all is the Amazon return process.  It will only let me return the product through UPS pickup.  This is not an option for me as I do not have the ability to wait for a UPS pickup in my neighborhood compound.
Ginger Ale,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good buy,"This was a good purchase, holds its charge. nice screen settings,and print size adjustments.  My only down side is figuring out how to get to the home page, I finally figured it out, but its3not eady"
Enrique F. Benavides Jr.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t get the clear protective cover my kindle wasn’t responding well cover is too thick,Same as above
Autumn Branscome,5.0 out of 5 stars,It works,"I held out for so long, but I am so happy I ended up getting one! The main page sometimes takes a bit to respond to my touch but other then that I have very little complaints about it. I'm pretty sure I told all of my reader friends to get one."
BrittKayyW,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love,Love it!
Whimsical16,5.0 out of 5 stars,Epic Battery Life,"I think this thing would last through an entire apocalypse. The battery life is epic. I've needed to charge it maybe twice in the past three months. And, I don't use it sparingly. I love my kindle, and I love how the lighting is adjustable as well. The only thing I don't like is that you can only listen to audiobooks via bluetooth and not a physical connection with corded earbuds. Other than that, it's great!"
maleko,1.0 out of 5 stars,What a goat rodeo,"The advertised integration between audible and kindle is utter crap ! It works better on an iPad… so I tried to return it and that’s where the real fun began. I set up the return and asked Amazon to send me a label via mail because my printer was broken so I waited five days. Got the label packaged up the Kindle and took it to the UPS store and the label didn’t work now Mai Vu I spent a dollar extra to have Amazon send me a label so when the UPS store said I needed to get another label from Amazon I called up Amazon customer service once again and after struggling with a gentleman from India, that clearly didn’t have command of the English language  I was able to explain the situation which she was very apologetic for so I said I need another label sent to my address and he said OK but will charge you a dollar and I said well. I already paid you a dollar and you sent me a label that didn’t work why should I have to pay you another dollar  and he goes well that’s how we have to do it so I’m a bit irritated with Amazon. They advertise functionality of the device just wasn’t there. I’ve probably spent $15-$20 in gas going back-and-forth UPS stores two dollars in labels one of which did not work and I’m still sitting here with the Kindle that I don’t want waiting on another label to be able to send it back , dear Amazon, get people that speak English to deal with people that speak English. I’m at a place where I probably won’t buy from you for a very long time solely based on this experience you might say some bucks outsourcing to India but it’s really gonna cost you in the long run , cause I’m not the only one experiencing this chronic poor customer Service"
taylor perdue,5.0 out of 5 stars,Addicted to this kindle!,"I had the old original kindle and never liked it but decided to give this a try since I’ve gotten back into reading a lot lately. I take this kindle everywhere!! The paper white is so nice, changing the warmth/light options for different times of the day or to make reading easier on the eyes is amazing, it’s light weight and sooo many books available always. The battery life is forever, I’ve read three books and I’m still at 73%. Anyone who enjoys reading and goes through books quickly should have one. So convenient."
Deepa,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth,"I am a bookaholic, I love reading and do not have a chance since I had a baby. My husband got me this as a gift and I am in love. Cannot express how happy I am to get back on the groove to enjoy reading all over again."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product & super long charge,"I love this Kindle! The charge lasts literally forever. I've had it for a month and only had to charge it once besides the initial charge and I've used it daily. I love the screen brightness and you can dim it and make it warm for when you're reading in bed. This Kindle has got me back into reading! I only have time to read before bed and it's hard to read an actual book with a flashlight while lying down, so this has been perfect! Highly recommend 😊"
B. J. Fox,1.0 out of 5 stars,Battery issue,"I purchased a 16 gig Paperwhite in May 2023. I have had no problems with  it until the past couple days. The battery is going dead ( from a full charge) in a matter of hours. I keep the e-reader on the table beside my chair. No rough treatment or anything.  It was wonderful! Now I can't even read a full day without the battery dropping 80 to 90% in a matter of hours.What is going on? Very, very upset and disappointed."
Kirk Land,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well worth it,Acclimating to device was a challenge but performance is outstanding
skyesbookishlife,5.0 out of 5 stars,My new favorite way to read!,"I am so glad I ended up buying this! I was using my phone to read with the Kindle app previously and was causing eye strain and of course extra battery drainage. Was also very difficult to read outside.Now with my kindle I haven't had any eye strain and reading outside in the sun is so easy to see even with the brightness at 0. I really do feel like I'm reading from a book visually.It's very comfortable to hold in my hand and I enjoy having many books with me when out and about.Battery life is wonderful I have had this for 3 weeks now and only charged it once, I do quite a bit of reading daily so that has been a wonderful plus!Also compact enough to fit easily into my backpack purse but large enough the screen size is about the size of a normal sized book. Definitely a good screen size.Definitely recommend this kindle to anyone shopping around for a new e-reader!"
Curt Murphy,5.0 out of 5 stars,kindle,son uses it every night
Siedha Stephens,5.0 out of 5 stars,Can’t put it down,Best purchase I’ve made in a very long time
Evertiro,5.0 out of 5 stars,Zero regrets,"Bought one of these for a friend for his birthday, and decided to buy on for myself at the same time. I spend a ton of time in the hospital, and reading books on my phone just never felt right. This thing made a world of difference! I could read on this all day without any issues (and have) and can't imagine how I survived reading on my phone for so long. Buy one!"
Lisa,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love Love Love,How did I live without this.  Stays charged for Days.
Robert Sullivan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product!,"I am a bibliophile who enjoys a quality product,the Kindle Paperwhite fits the bill."
MHL,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Kindle,I always enjoy reading on this Kindle. Very easy and convenient to use.
Emma Cowgill,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth it if you buy a lot of physical books and need to save $!,"With physical books being $10-20 a piece, I was spending a decent amount of money each week. Now I have whatever I want to read with Kindle Unlimited for $12 a month (got three months free with this purchase). Tried Kobo Clara 2E first and couldn't figure it out, when I got the kindle, it took a minute to set up!"
KimC,5.0 out of 5 stars,2nd time is the charm,This is my second kindle - my first one was take from out hotel room. It’s a little larger and it’s great. It holds a charge or at least10 hours and charges very quickly. Super easy to set up and easy to use.
Stephen M.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Great, until it was defective. Customer Service would be nice.","The product was great when it worked. The battery life was everything my wife expected.Now the real issue is with Amazon and their ""support"" of the device. Remember when you would talk to great human beings on the other end of the phone with support? Those days are long gone. Amazon has made talking to a human near impossible. This device is still eligible to replace, yet there isn't anything I can do to get past ""how to troubleshoot"".Amazon it was your customer service that got you to where you are today. Your business will slowly falter if you do not turn your customer service around. Service used to be the best part of your business."
Daniel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great,Great
Kathy P,3.0 out of 5 stars,stopped working,I've only had this kindle 7 months. Today it was fully charged and is frozen. Went through all suggestions/watched videos -- nothing worked. Now what do I do???
Karen R. La Porta,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice but be aware…,"This Kindle is lovely because of its size. The problems are that there is NO COLOR and YOU CANNOT TURN IT OFF! How weird, but the review said not to worry, so I tried it. So far, I love the size and am adjusting to having no color. I took the Paperwhite outside and had no glare, which was another plus!"
Tracy J.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Returned it,We couldn’t get my dads account to connect and I received very poor customer service when I called for help so I returned it.
RonnieJohn,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome Gift & Great Product,"Amazon definitely did it right with this updated version of the Kindle Paperwhite! I purchased this as a retirement gift for my mother (to help keep her occupied). The screen is very great for both indoor and outdoor use, with the option to change the color temps around. The tablet fits great while using it while sitting around, walking, or lying in bed. The setup process was a bit annoying, with having to bounce back and forth signing into my Amazon account and syncing everything. But other than that we don't have any complaints."
Alicia Wood,5.0 out of 5 stars,To help with my eyes,I bought the kindle because I was reading a lot on my phone. I wanted something that I can adjust to make it easier on my eyes because the bright screen would hurt after a while. I can say now that I’ve had this kindle for a few weeks that I can read as long as I want without eye strain! I love being able to adjust the brightness and warmth for my comfort.
Heather Beckett,2.0 out of 5 stars,Keeps blinking and can’t order replacement,I want to love this but it keeps blinking. I reached out for a replacement and they sent me a new cover. Frustrating
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love it,I bought it to replace my previous Kindle because I wanted the light. I read a lot so I enjoy being able to adjust the lighting and text size. Bought a Kindle cover too.
Aaron Weinard,5.0 out of 5 stars,Highly recommended,Great seller! Kindle arrived as expected and on time!
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reboots ALOT. Otherwise, great device.",I really don’t like that I have to return it for repairs within 30 days of purchase for a known and common issue. I was really enjoying the device. I was able to read in a dark room without disturbing or distracting others trying to sleep. I like that’s there’s no distraction to go and read or scroll throw anything else. I like that it bookmarks my page. I like how light it is. I like the ability to borrow and read a library book without actually going to the library.
Pacificair,5.0 out of 5 stars,as good as it gets,just like the previous one but better
Svend Hardenberg,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Quality of the screen,I like the quality of the screen and the classic no bull setup of the kindle - it works as it should.
Megan Bell,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best yet!,"As an avid book reader my whole life, I was very reluctant to move to a kindle, but I needed a booger house for all the books. Moved to a kindle in 2009. Just left my kindle at a hotel and had to buy this new version! WOW! This is the best one yet, quite glad I lost mine now. The pages are the most similar to a book, screen is bigger but still light weight. Absolutely love my new kindle!"
James J Gorman,4.0 out of 5 stars,Functionality,"Generally, I like this reader, except for maneuvering. Too few functions. If you hate a book, ot is difficult to get out of it. Best to use computer or cell phone to add or delete Kindel books. Frustrating!"
A. Version,5.0 out of 5 stars,Magical product,"I love reading on this Kindle. As I am not tech saavy, it was surprisingly easy to set up. I am a new user so I have not discovered all of its features yet. What I have discovered which is the adjustable lighted screen, ability to set the font size, ease of changing pages both back and ahead, page numbers that closely correspond to the book, long battery life and notification of percentage of book already read are all simply wonderful. My eyes do not get tired nor strained even after many hours of reading. I find the Kindle to be magical."
Mary A. Violet,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love it!,"I had been putting off buying a Kindle because I love the feel of a physical book in my hands. I decided to do a pros and cons comparison list and obviously the pros won out. My biggest reason for getting it was that I live in a small apartment and am out of space for more bookshelves and rather than moving, which is a pain, I decided this was the best solution to my problem.With what I’ve saved in buying Kindle books as opposed to physical books I believe that it has paid for itself. I will still purchase an occasional physical book, for a favorite author or to complete a series I already own, but that’s it. If you’re on the fence about buying one, do a pros/cons comparison like I did.I’m officially a Kindle convert!"
Ana Gann,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,"I’ve been thinking of getting a kindle off and on for a long time. I finally decided to get one and I am obsessed with it! It’s so lightweight compared to my old tablet I was using. I’m not a huge fan of the button being on the bottom of it, but the case I got for it easily fixed that problem. The battery life is great!"
BeautyBySimone,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good!,Just received and I’m loving it!!! I wish my nursing textbook was on this!
