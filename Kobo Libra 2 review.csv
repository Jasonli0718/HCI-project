JORGE Z.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good purchase,Sometimes I can't download all the books I buy on platforms other than the Kobo brand,
Dorn,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great reader but handles metadata poorly,"If Amazon bothered to support modern image formats you'd see my reader thinking ""Sanderson, Brandon"" and ""Brandon Sanderson"" being two different authors. This is likely due to a metadata thing, but the reader should be able to handle this.That said, the view is great. It's easy on the eyes, a bit wider than I'd like but not terrible. It works well, I like it, and it's 1000x better than a Kindle because it's supported by Calibre.If you buy one, get a case. It makes it very comfortable in the hand. It's well worth $200 if you already have a collection of DRM free epub files. The Kindle sucks at that and this stands head and shoulders over it for that reason.This is a great reader, I love it.",
Tom N.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good but flawed,"Ok, first off this reader is much quicker than my Kindle 10. Bluetooth is nice but not used by me. The biggest problem is the inability to direct many ebooks found on Libby, the direct content loader app that's Kobo-supported. This means that the ebook has to be converted on a PC or Mac with Adobe Digital Editions first, then ""side-loaded"" to the Libra 2. Come on Rakuten, get with it and add ADE to this device's firmware. One star off.",
Dion F. Wolfe,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,My wife uses her Kobo daily. No issues. Easy to use. Holds a charge for a long period of time,
Franco,1.0 out of 5 stars,Two bad items,I received two items that wouldn't turn on. Then they tell me that there is no problem that I will receive a refund for the item and there is no need to send them back and then they tell me otherwise. Very bad experience shopping in this store and on Amazon in general,
Zafarrancho,5.0 out of 5 stars,Alright,Recommended size,
John C.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good reader,"It's a nice device, a little sluggish in the menus. But nice features while reading books. Just about the right size for one handed use. Backlight works well.",
Autumn Sevier,4.0 out of 5 stars,good little device,"ordered this a couple weeks ago and i'm really liking it so far .  i've not used their store front but it seems fine.  i've  only side loaded EPUBs so far but its not given me any issues.  i can go days without charging it and i've never dipped past a half battery and it seems to charge quickly.  the lighting being adjustble has been great in bed in a dark room with my partner sleeping next to me as its easy on the eyes .  the sleep screen hows your book's cover so thats rather neat.  the swiping options on the screen are also customizable just in case your the tyupe to accidentally bang into certain spots, and the best part is it has buttons on the side...also its comfotable enough to hold in one hand between 2 fingers for hours at a time like a good ole paperback.only con i've found thus far is its durablity .  not really fault of the device itself so much as a user error but it slid off the bed the 2nd night i got it and landed on a power plug causing some minorr gashes on the side of the devices shell.  i would have thought it would have been made with a tougher material.  that said its just cosmetic damage no fuctional issues so it is what it is.either way i'd recommend this e-reader",
Mario F. Sangines,4.0 out of 5 stars,Small but easy to read,"The screen is small but the contrast is good and easy on the eyes.  I had to get used to book shopping in this Rakuten platform, took some getting used to but it seems well stocked.  Battery life is decent.  Only complaint is that it sometimes jumps to the end or beginning of the book and you have to manually find your place.",
Dilanka,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Great intentions, poor execution - too buggy to be usable.","I REALLY wanted to love this, but after having used it for 3 months, I can't.This could have been the perfect device for someone like me who wants a less restrictive option like the DRM prison enforced by companies like Amazon.My use case was simple: I just wanted to upload my ePub books into the device for reading, and I use Calibre for managing and transferring my library to my Kobo.At first, I thought it was going to work well, but I was wrong.This thing is SO BUGGY.Considering Kobo has been making e-readers for close to 12 YEARS now, I think it's inexcusable.I have had to reset and re-upload my books multiple times... while losing my reading position(s) on multiple books on each attempt.Then, there are random glitches involving connection problems.Calibre would say ""ERROR: Error: Error communicating with device, CorruptError: database disk image is malformed"" and I would have to reset the entire device.Then there are random glitches involving the books themselves.Recently, while in the middle of reading a book, it would randomly freeze, then restart, then when I re-open the book again, it would show a (wrong) page about 15 pages back.It's passed the return window, so I don't know what I'm going to do with this useless paperweight, but I might give it another... going on perhaps 7th attempt to make it work.The biggest annoyance is losing my reading position over and over again on multiple books.The ""Pocket"" integration is also useless as Pocket won't let me save any web pages from paid subscription news sites like NYT, FT etc., which is the entire point of wanting to use Pocket.Overall, a big disappointment.Great intentions, yes, but poor execution.I've spent more time tinkering with this device to get it to work than actually read.",
tyler golightly,2.0 out of 5 stars,Deleted all my progress randomly,Almost two years of progress gone in an instance. Get a different e reader.This will probably piss you off after you waste your time and money.,
Chris Hulstein,5.0 out of 5 stars,Converted from Kindle to Kobo,"Let's preface this by saying that I've been an avid Kindle user for the past few years. I started with a Kindle Voyager (wonderful e-reader) and have had two Kindle Paperwhites in the past couple of years - the most recent of which is the Paperwhite Signature edition. The Kobo Libra 2 is my first Kobo.I love it. I love the fact that it's functional for reading. That's why we got e-readers, right? To read things? No BS. No constant advertisements that you need to spend $20 to remove. The ability to borrow books from your library directly from the e-reader is so lovely. The fact that it plays well with other formats. The fact that it feels SO NICE in the hand is probably the top reason I love it. The asymmetrical design (yes - Oasis has this as well...but I don't like the feel of the Oasis...which is also much more expensive) is very comfortable to hold - and the Kobo is light - in many cases, it's lighter than a book! It's waterproof. It has page turn buttons (I thought I wouldn't want those and that they looked silly compared to the buttonless technology we have today - nope. They're nice. Function first). The fact that the screen isn't flush seemed weird, too - but you get a crisper page that way - and, yes, you can notice it.I've been converted. I've tasted Kobo, and I'm not looking back. Will I still keep my Kindle around? Absolutely - I've got quite a few books I've purchased through Kindle that I would like to hold on to - and I still love my Kindle. Could I read those through the Kindle app on my phone or laptop? Absolutely - but I prefer the e-reader experience over a phone screen. But moving forward, I think I'll be sticking with Kobo. Do I still recommend Kindles? Yes! But I just might recommend a Kobo first. And I dunno - maybe this is going to be like the Android vs iPhone or Mac vs PC kinda thing (it probably will be/is). I'm team Kobo.Here's a summary of the pros and cons I've noticed after having my Kobo for a few days:Things that bring me joy:- Very comfortable to hold (for my Paperwhite, I depend on the sleep cover to hold it properly - I don't need that with the Kobo. I also tried out the Oasis a while back, but I didn't like how the back cut into my hand...with the Kobo Libra, my hand stays comfortable, even after reading for hours)- You can rotate the device, and the screen will keep up. I switch from holding it in my right hand to my left hand...the Libra 2 will rotate the screen to accommodate this. Heck - you can even read it in landscape if you want to (maybe easier for certain formats/pubs). And if you don't, you can lock it to be only in portrait mode.- Page turn buttons (that you can program for which button turns the page forward or backward)- No ads- Waterproof (yes - Kindles have this, too!)- Clearer screen (you don't have extra layers of glass/plastic in front of it)- Lightweight (lighter than quite a few books - I legit weighed them out of curiosity)- Direct integration with OverDrive (for you Kindle users out there, Libby now owns OverDrive - if you're used to going to Libby to link your library card to your Kindle, it's similar - but with Kobo, you don't NEED the Libby app on your phone to do this - you just do it from the Kobo)- The power button IS ON THE BACK OF THE KOBO (you don't accidentally tap the power button like you might on Kindle - is that just me??)- Did I mention how comfortable it is to hold? (seriously - I noticed the second that I pulled it out of the box that I was going to prefer reading on this thing)- The ability to easily load fonts (Bookerly is probably my favorite font at this point - I came to love it over the past few years having a Kindle...didyaknow that you can load Bookerly to your Kobo? Name a font, and you can do it in a matter of a couple of minutes. Have done. Works perfectly.)- You can purchase books through Kobo's store, just like the Kindle store (are there as many titles? No - but it's an option when your library doesn't have it)- You can set your sleep screen to be blank. Or you can set it to be the book you're currently reading (without having to spend $20 extra to remove ads)- There's a Kobo app for your phone just like a Kindle app- It's so comfortable to hold! (wait I think I already said that...)- USB -C charging- warm light backlighting - backlight can be adjusted easily by just swiping your finger up or down along the outside of the screen- Uh...32 gigs of storage? Who needs that? But it's there for audiobooks, I suppose. And that's just inherently built in...in case you need to store the entire contents of the Library of Alexandria on there or something along those lines...- Audiobooks - yes, it can store them and play them via Bluetooth...but I personally don't use an e-reader to listen to audiobooks. It's 2023, and I have a cellphone. I personally don't see the point of adding audiobooks to an e-reader (it's an e-reader...not an e-listener). But if others find that a necessity, it's available on this device!- Direct Pocket integration! I'VE YET TO USE THIS FEATURE BUT HEY IT'S THERE!Things that don't bring me joy:- Fingerprint central. The plastic/coating that's used shows fingerprints like nobody's business. I have the black version, so I'm not sure if the white version would be better...but black looks nicer IMO...so fingerprints it is. I don't have greasy fingers (and I live in Colorado...so they're not exactly sweaty either). But man, oh man. It looks like I just polished off a bag of potato chips after I look at all the prints on this thing.- Can be glitchy sometimes. The software experience isn't quite as smooth as Kindle - not gonna lie. The vast majority of the time, It works as it should (yep - page has turned correctly). Rarely, it does freeze. But holding the power button to jolt it back has worked fine so far...will see how things fare over the next several months/year.- CAN feel cheap - I think this might be because it feels lighter - I DEFINITELY prefer the lighter feel of this to the heavier Paperwhite...but it doesn't FEEL like I spent this much money on this device. The plastic sometimes pops/clicks every once in a while.- Pattern on the back - it's got this pattern on the back that I'm not sure if it's supposed to make the thing grippier? Or cool? But dust and crumbs get stuck in it. It looks like the Clara 2E is changing things up a bit, and that looks like a nicer backing- Very few 3rd party accessories - this isn't a Kindle. It's MUCH tougher to find accessories for Kobo products. For a sleeve, I ended up looking for Oasis accessories. I'm personally not going to get a sleep cover for my Kobo (I don't really need one from a grippy perspective - and I don't want to ruin the feel of it in my hands)...but if I did want to get a sleep cover, I found that options are quite limited.Overall Impressions:Yes.I honestly can't wait for them to come out with a Libra 2E or whatever will be next. I love this thing more than I love lamp. And I've been telling all my friend to get one.",
Brian Bridges,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great and affordable, for PDFs and ePubs","I've been using this Kobo libra 2 for about a month now, and it's worked very well for the purposes I had intended. I have several Linux PDFs to read through, and sometimes I want them on hand while using various computers, so this small light-weight tablet works great for that, especially considering its affordable price. I also downloaded some ePub documents and they are even *more* useful, as you can easily change the font size and such.I love the form-factor of the tablet, that it doesn't really have a ""right side up,"" you can kind of just hold it in whatever way is comfortable to you. As I mentioned, it's very light weight, and the paper-esque screen looks great. The touch screen navigation and the physical buttons were well thought out, and the tablet has some good customization settings.Transferring the books from PC to tablet was easy, I had no issues there. The battery life of this thing is fantastic. I only use it sporadically once in a while, but I haven't charged it in a month and it's not even half-way drained yet.I have just a few minor nitpicks. The tablet isn't the fastest. Sometimes I'll click on a book and have to wait a moment before it will open, and there's about a 1-second delay with each page turn, and word-search, and things like that.The internet browser in this tablet barely functions, but if you want that feature, you should buy a more expensive tablet. This thing is just for reading books. Anyway, I forgive all these nitpicks, because the tablet didn't cost very much and it works well for what it's intended to do.All things considered, I'm very happy with my purchase and it's a handy portable device to carry with me. If reading PDFs and ePubs is the *only* thing you want to do with it, then I definitely recommend this Kobo libra 2.",
Rach,2.0 out of 5 stars,Freezes,"I’m so disappointed. I liked how it was functioning for about a month, but now it freezes and shut down on its own every time I turn a page. I’ve never dropped it once, so I don’t know what’s going on. This is ridiculous. I’m about to switch to a kindle oasis.",
Jeannie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great ereader,Since Amazon has made it so hard to put ebooks not purchased from Amazon on the Kindle I purchased the Kobo.  It is so much easier to get ebooks on the Kobo ereader that arent purchased at Amazon.  Also like the Libra 2 because it reminds me of the Oasis.,
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Rip off if return product,Purchased to download audiobooks from local library.  Couldn't do it.  Kobo pushed purchasing audiobooks from their site.  Couldn't download Libby software either.  Returned ebook and they hit be with $28.50. restocking fee plus shipping cost..  This is outrageous.  Would never purchase from this company again.,
Ago,5.0 out of 5 stars,Kobo the best eReader!,Very good product.,
Ronald,5.0 out of 5 stars,Finaly a screen with real black letters.,"Sept 21stAfter a month of experimenting and use, I have found other options that make a difference. I found that in beta features > large print mode, which increases the print size of the dictionary popup, very useful because I had trouble reading the small print size.  i can also increase the weight of the font (in advanced) which helps make the letters more  black for reading. I still think that the e-readers without touch screen have a blacker and more contrasty screen which I miss from my Kindle keyboard. (I think the problem with the touch screen is the extra layer on top of the screen which seems to reflect light inside and makes the letters more grey or washed out) But this format weight option has improved the contrast, and with coming from a 6 inch screen to a 7 inch, I can use a slightly bigger font size to compensate. I could not go back to a 6 inch, and am really happy with the Kobo 7 inch.At first I was reading English language books but later side loaded Spanish books and had a problem with it not reading properly the accents and tildes, and leaving a space before and after the letter. To make a long story short, I found out that the font ""AR UD jingxihei"" which I was using is for the Chinese language. There was no indication, and I wasted a lot of time trying to find out, so I warn others who might fall into this error.Forget about the internet. Only good for buying books.Received my Kobo yesterday. Very happy, and thrilled. Even more than I expected. More contrast, better definition, than my old Kindle keyboard. (I still think the real black letters of the Kindle keyboard were better than the first ""Paperwhites"") A little more speed than the keyboard, but nothing special, is good enough for reading. They say it's a little slow on pdfs and internet, but I am not interested in those. The menus are logical, short, and practical. I like the page turn buttons, which work well. I don't know why some reviewers complained about the buttons.Going from a 6 inch screen to 7 inch makes more difference than one would think.Years ago I bought one of the first paper-white with internal lights but was not happy with the contrast, sold it and went back to the keyboard. This time I bought the Libra 2 with a little fear, because of my past experience, but I am very satisfied with the Kobo for reading books. I can't say anything yet  about the other functions.I had been studying up on internet and learning how to convert my files not only to ePub but also to Kepub (Kobo-pub) which can show more details on your book while reading: title, chapter, pages and time left to go in chapter, time for next chapter, percent of book read etc.A lot of dictionary s to choose from.I am also very pleased with the Fintie case: 5 stars.",
Linda Scott,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice reader,"So I'm new to ""readers,"" but have read off my tablet for a long time.  I'm not a big reader, but I'm trying to do that more, so a nice, light-weight, dedicated reader seemed like it would help.  I chose this one because it has OverDrive already in place and ready to go -- and I read mostly library loan books, so I thought that would be more convenient. I had a couple of hiccups getting that working (mostly my ignorance).I don't have any previous experience to compare it to (except it's far superior to reading on a tablet), but I'll say that reading is a pleasure.  Good screen, touch-screen or buttons work perfectly.  I thought the small screen would bother me, but it's so easy to page up it's not an issue at all.  I love that it has auto-rotate, I'm learning that for holding it when I'm reading outside I like vertical where I can hold the large side handle, but I have a ""thing"" to hold it while I sit leisurely by the window indoors, and then I prefer horizontal.  It's okay to be spoiled :-)It has very nice and easy adjustments - just slide a bar to increase type size or brightness.  I like their typeface and spacing options.  I've had it for four days and I'm mostly playing with it so far, and it's lost half its charge in that time.  I don't think that's a huge deal, but others have commented about it.I'm struggling a little about just one thing -- it does not support the X-Ray feature that Kindle has to keep track of characters -- for whatever reason I have a problem remembering the names of the many secondary characters even a day later, and I have used X-Ray pretty regularly to keep up.  I like that feature. It may only available on Kindles, but for an expensive and high-end reader, I think it should have such useful features as this.  But the quality of the screen (and the bigger size) are top notch.",
Steve Mills,1.0 out of 5 stars,Major wifi and Bluetooth problems,1. Won't find either wifi or BT on my samsung note 9 phone.2. Will find both Wifi and BT iphone x and ipad pro.....BUT cannot connect to them.,
Chris,5.0 out of 5 stars,It is exactly as advertised - and I love that,"This is my first e-reader so I kind of knew what to expect but I have no experience with other such devices. The price seemed a little expensive (about the cost of 15 books) but it was priced competitively against all the other readers of it's class.I like that it is exactly as advertised:The lighting is consistent on my device and the color grade from blue-white to white to yellowish is smooth and customizable. Even at very low settings on the brightness it stays consistent, so keeping the light very low while reading at night in bed next to your partner is very possible with this reader.Overdrive integration just works.I use a free software to transfer over a collection of epub books I've previously gotten. Worked like a charm; no headaches.Page turning is fast when using the buttons, I would say about a quarter of a second or faster. There is a slight delay using the touchscreen to turn the page, about half a second. It's not bad but a little noticeable. Black screen with white text works well though sometimes when you page turn it flashes the inverse before applying the white text on black theme. Not a big deal, its not like the brightness changes.The device is pretty light and the side bezel is perfect to fit under the base of the thumb. The buttons are ergonomic easy to press with the tip of your thumb for page turning. I have a bit of a gut so if you are like me you can sit in a recliner and rest it on your gut and page turn with the buttons easily.The size of the device is about perfect. Big enough that I can expand the text on the screen a little and the screen still shows lots of text so you are page-turning constantly. It's about the size of two Galaxy S10+ put side-to-side. Except it weighs maybe slightly less that just one of the phones. The weight is balanced nicely on the device, slightly heavier on the bezel side where you grip it but not too much so.Battery life seems solid. I know their metric is 30 minutes of reading per day and I have my device on the white-text-on-black and about 15% brightness but I can see by that amount of reading it will probably last as long as advertised. If you are a heavy reader you will get about a week of reading before you need to plug it in. From 1% charge it took about 2 hours to get it to full, though I'm guessing as I didn't really time it. Considering how much reading you get from just a few percentages of battery life that's perfectly fine.It's water-resistant! I live in a rainy climate. I could go outdoors with it and not have to worry about it dying. I wouldn't submerge the thing in the ocean but this could be read in the bathtub without worry or be taken on a camping trip or hike. Some other similarly priced readers don't have this feature.Overall, this was exactly what I was hoping for when I purchased it.Oh, but there is a downside. My partner saw it and now I have to buy another for them, LOL.",
Annabella,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for early readers,"Bought this for my 6yo son to read comics and early reader material like Dog Man. He quickly got used to the controls and buttons in 1 day and it has really helped developed his interest in reading. I was a bit worried at first as I had heard of the Kobo freezing but touch wood hasn’t happened to us. Everything has been really smooth.Greater seller, super fast delivery and well packaged. Definitely recommend!",
Pdxnative83,2.0 out of 5 stars,Endless restart cycle or unresponsive,"I so badly wanted to like this, I'd gotten tired of the kindle and this looked great, but soon it got less and less responsive and now i can't even try to troubleshoot because it's just on a restart cycle whenever it's on.",
Princess,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best purchase ever!!!,It has been with me for more than half a year and no regrets on buying this product.,
Geoffrey Fortier,2.0 out of 5 stars,Initially Great But Lack Longevity,"At first I was delighted to have an alternative reader.  The design is pleasant to hold, the interface uncluttered (and not ad-supported) and worked well with all my sources of reading material.  I recommended it to many friends looking for an eReader.Then after ~11 months, the battery stopped holding a charge. Even with maximum power savings, no use, and in full sleep mode, the device will fully discharge itself in 24-36 hours.  This really makes it dead in the water for me as a device I can carry around, keep on my nightstand or travel with.Kobo support on their website goes nowhere.  After trying all the suggestions in their documentation, and attempting to chat with a representative, you are sent to a chat window that never loads.I didn't really think I was buying a disposable device with a lifespan of less than a year, but apparently that is what Kobo has manufactured here.  Very disappointed.",
Madison P.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Kobo store is nothing compared to Kindle…,"I wanted to like this and I did in a lot of ways. I adored the page turn buttons and the overall interface. My main issue is with the kobo platform. Their store sucks, quite frankly, and their customer service is god awful! If you’re in the US, just go with the kindle as you’ll have a better overall experience.",
Valentino,1.0 out of 5 stars,Too slow,"It's too slow for everything you need to process. Too slow to turn on, too slow to change in the menu. It's not very user-friendly to handle. I would really like to change it. I haven't been able to use it however I wanted.",
Cynthia Parker,1.0 out of 5 stars,Could be good,This e-reader could be good but I wouldn't know because I can't get it registered so can't use it. Their website sign in has for 5 days kept telling me that the sign in is temporarily unavailable please try again later. Well I didn't pay almost $200 for a paperweight and that's what this e-reader has become at this point. I will give them until Friday but if the sign in is still down I'm sending it back.  I can't believe they've let this go on for so long nobody can get ebooks or register their readers if they can't sign in.,
Frederick Nunes,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Reading Experience,"I believe this reader has unseated Kindles in my opinion.  I purchased it directly from KOBO.  NOT AMAZON.  The design of this is as good as I've seen.  Textured back that feels incredible in hand.  No oil from skin like the poorly designed Kindles.  I find this is by bypass the new Paperwhite (Owned that ) because firstly, it has page turn buttons.  Text is sharper.  The thicker bezel is cleverly thought out to allow for one hand to hold and turn pages.  Kindles bezels are thin, no page turn buttons, just an awkward design.  Added to the the seamless integration to borrow titles from your library.I have taken my Kindles off line and will be giving them away.  Recent lottery winnings has made me very generous.",
Jorge Alejandro Recalde,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome Ebook!,"it's a great product to read, i'm happy with my kobo",
Pete,4.0 out of 5 stars,works OK,"LITTLE BIT SLOW, BUT ITS OK FOR ME",
jonathan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,Love this and am reading so much more now that I can access Libby (Overdrive) directly! It feels sturdy and is lovely. I definitely prefer it to my former kindle.,
Carnamagos,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Unresponsive, Difficult-To-Use Piece Of Garbage","After reading many reviews, including, of course, professional, non-Amazon reviews, I have high hopes for the Kobo Libra 2--none of which bore out in reality.In addition to being difficult to use, in general, and not having a particularly attractive or easy-to-read to display, I want to point out the main flaw in this piece of garbage, one that led to its destination in my trash can: Its slowness and lack of responsiveness to touch controls. These features are absolutely essential to an eBook reader, and they fail miserably here.Tap a book to read? Well, be prepared to wait several seconds for it to open. Want to navigate different menus? Again, you'd better have something else to entertain you while the reader switches menus, because it son't happen instantaneously, or even in a reasonable amount of time. Tap the three dots in order to remove a book from the device? Instead, the unwanted book not only does not allow an attempt to delete it, but instead opens. Try again? Same result.This piece of junk should not even be on the market until these flaws are resolved. And if other users do not experience the same problem, then all that says to me is that Kobo's quality control leaves much to be desired, if it is shipping working as well as non-working models. If you do take a chance on one of these readers, then I implore you to test it thoroughly within the return period, to make sure that it actually works. Don't be a fool like me and wait too long, and therefore have no other recourse than to throw this piece of junk into the trash where mine, at least, belongs.",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great reader, great price, no ads",Looking to drop your epub collection on something and go? This is it! I gave my son this for a gift. It took 5 mins to load up and he was off to explore history. Navigation could be upgraded slightly. It does work just fine as is. Battery life and lighting is great. I will buy myself one after I finish a stack of hardcover books.,
Rizzo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Supports epub and overdrive,"I picked this over a kindle for the following reasons:1) supports epub. Project Gutenberg has thousands of public domain books and epub is the format of choice for independent authors. I already had a bunch of epubs... and I dislike proprietary formats like amazon's .mobi.2) supports overdrive if you want to borrow books from libraries.3) I didn't have to pay more to remove ads.4) Kobo by Rakuten is the only other player of note in the ereader game.This device works great. Snappy, easy to use, waterproof, has a great light built in. My last ereader was a nook, it was about 10 years old and still holds a charge and works fine. The screens have improved a lot and are a bit snappier now, also I like that this has a usb-c port which a lot of other devices I have use. My nook had mini usb which is an odd one now a days.Improvements:32gb is a lot of space for books, but I wish it had expandable storage, especially since it supports audiobooks and I have gigabytes of them that I'd like to store on here.In the end, I just built a plex media server and can add my audiobooks to that, and stream them from anywhere so it wasn't a deal breaker for me. Most ebook readers available in this price range no longer offer expandable storage either..",
William Hinckley,5.0 out of 5 stars,Compact eReader that’s easy to use and full of nice features,"I’ve been using it a few days and this reader is great. It’s easy to sync books, download them via their store, or link your library card to borrow eBooks from your local library. Linking my library card via Overdrive was a small hassle–the page wouldn’t load. The way I got it to work was to find a local library then log in via my library card number instead of logging into my Overdrive account and linking my library card.If you’re primarily using this to read books and not as anything more, this goes toe to toe with the Kindle Paperwhite Signature.",
Momster,2.0 out of 5 stars,Very clunky and features are 15+ years old,"I bought this because I bought a Kobo reader years ago. At the time, the first one was OK; easy to read, easy to handle. BUT the features--the dictionary, the highlighting, and especially the search functions--were terrible even then. I was sure (foolish me) Kobo would have updated the software significantly in that time period... but nope. It's still awkward to highlight and make notes (not to mention s-l-o-w) and may all the gods help you if you want to look up a reference online, because if you find it, it will be in tiny print and you can't follow any links you may want to. (There is a slider where you can increase the size of the type, but that isn't much help when you want to look up something and links won't work.) As much as I prefer e-pub books to the Kindle format (I despise the proprietary attitude so prevalent today that means you can only buy books (or, ahem, accessories; I'm looking at you, bitten fruit) from that one company), I wish I hadn't gotten this thing. There has to be a better e-pub reader out there somewhere. (There used to be; Sony made a really good one and just dumped it.)",
Maria D. Flores,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use,"Not much on directions, unless your tech savy...works great,down loads are easy. All in all a good item",
Peter,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best reader I had so far.,"After couple kindles and trying to deal with missing features or annoyances I decided to give this reader a try. It's much better, reads more formats, and seems easier to use than couple kindles I had in the past.If you want to read stuff that is not in kindle/amazon store this reader is a much better option. Together with calibre it's easy to organize books by series, something I couldn't easily do with Kindle (unless you buy books from the store).",
GaryC,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a great ereader,"My old Kobo was a very good unit, and I probably read 400+ books on it.  This one seems better, in that the battery is new, so it keeps its charge better.  It also holds a lot of books.  I had 325 on my old one, and so far I only have about 40 on this one.  The lighting works as well or better than the last, and this unit is waterproof for about an hour.  Not that I'm getting it wet, but it's nice to know that wouldn't be a problem.  I REALLY like the fact that this one can be turned sideways and the print aligns as it should.  I bought the cover for this too, it works well but doesn't have a pocket...which bothers me...but I can live with it.  I'm guessing the people who design the cover never use it, or use an ereader.  But, hey, it's a great unit and I highly recommend it.",
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Kindle Paperwhite is faster and has longer battery life (and usually cheaper),"While I love this device because it allows me to read my books in a comfortable form factor as a piece of tech it's extremely underwhelming. The problems endemic to the Libra 2 are (I had to go through multiple devices to get one without defects):- Extremely outdated CPU that holds the device back in terms of performance and battery life- Smaller battery than competing devices, only a couple of weeks of battery with minimal usage. Battery drains dramatically doing anything that isn't turning a page in a book. Kobo should be honest and report the battery life in hours- Page turn buttons are lovely to have but awfully constructed, only one half of the button actually activates and depending on where you press it the resistance is completely different. A $5 remote has nicer buttons.- Build quality is lower than Kindle- Overpriced",
Lotus,5.0 out of 5 stars,great for manga,"perfect size for manga! beautiful screen, love it",
Jay,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than than kindle,"Best reader, great battery life even with wifi on, has buttons as well as the touch screen for turning pages, comfortlight pro easy on the eyes, 32gb storage, worth it!",
Lise Boorman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fabulous,"Liked it because it is very light and easily set up how you like it to work, like how you like reading it.  I recommend this product",
A. Hardesty,1.0 out of 5 stars,Dud products,Bought as a gift to replace another Kobo that didn't work right. Out of the box he charged this one overnight and it still won't turn on.I've NEVER had this problem with any of the 3 versions of Kindle that I've owned.,
Arianna S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best screen on a ereader,"Four stars for being a great sturdy device with good buttons and wonderful screen. Software is perfect and easy to use, love overdrive support. Wish it were a bit lighter to hold one handed. I found it easier to flip it sideward and read that way, it can rest on my knees that way.",
M. Derieux,2.0 out of 5 stars,My first e reader,Had no idea it would not transfer apple ebooks or kindle. Kobo bought books only 👎🏼I’m rating 2 stars because there are some free downloads available.,
lynnette,5.0 out of 5 stars,Old hardcore Nook fan,"In the past I have always been a hardcore nook enthusiast, I thought I'd try something different with this Kobo because of the reviews. I absolutely love it, I did have to get used to the large side lip, along with it feeling larger than my nook, only because I do not or did not use the physical buttons on either of the Kobo or my old Nook. But the extra options on this Kobo are absolutely beautiful. I am addicted to the dark mode and have not gone back to the regular reading mode since I got it. I definitely suggest getting either a cover with a handle, or like I did, a handle that sticks on a piece of Velcro to attach to the back. Without a handle,  you're definitely going to smack yourself in the head if you tend to read at night lying down. One bad thing I have noticed is that the battery life is not as good as on my old Nook, I do have to charge it probably twice as much.",
Bootstrap,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic Alternative to Kindle,"If you'd like a device that natively supports EPubs, works with the latest version of Calibre, and has far less DRM restrictions as opposed to competitors, this is the EReader for you!",
Chris Andrzejewski,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than the Oasis.,"I am a diehard Kindle user but after a few failed attempts at other than Kindle E readers I decided to give this a try. It is not better than Amazon Kindles but in my opinion it destroys the Oasis. It’s lighter, thicker, easier to handle and lightening fast. I hope Amazon will somehow copy the design of this for their next Oasis. I only bought this for the Kobo + feature. I am able to read free books that I can’t on Kindle Unlimited. Will it replace my Kindles? No, but it’s like Apple and Android. Android is fun but you always revert back to Apple. It’s kind of like cheating. Fun and thrilling until it gets boring and you go back!",
Will,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Poor Quality, No Support","My expectations were not outrageous with the Libre2.  I was replacing an old and definately battered unit I left behind in a hotel room. The new Libre2 I also purchased a screen cover. I noticed the screen was frozen with lines accross the face and it would not clear with a re-boot. My old Kobo has multiple Crack as well as a small hole in the screen but still worked fine. The Libre2 fails immediately with screen damage. As well, there is no physical damage whatsoever on the reader.  And of course immediately cancelation of warranty.  No option to purchase a reacemnt screen. Have to go back to my Kindle.",
Justin,2.0 out of 5 stars,It’s cheap,"As much as I loathe Amazon, I couldn’t handle this over the Kindle Oasis. The body felt super cheap; page turn buttons were flimsy.The screen constantly had ghosting from the previous page. The only plus to this device was USB-C charging.",
Steve,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best reader I have owned.,The battery hast lasted over a month! Buttons are essential! Great reader!,
Parnassus,5.0 out of 5 stars,Terrific ereader,"Great device for reading epub & pdf format. If you prize freedom from the Kindle constraints, this is the answer. Very comfortable using it for long periods of time. Technical quibble: should be able to sort books by filename.",
J. Flood,5.0 out of 5 stars,A much needed upgrade!,"For the longest time, I really enjoyed reading books. I also loved collecting them, in grand hopes in the future i'd leap forward and read everything i've gathered. That started with a older first gen kindle (thing had ads!) and sadly after years I stopped using it and not getting back into it much. I still collected books, but never had that real 'push' to read.Gotta say, I think that's gonna change.I knew I didn't want a kindle and instead looking into alternatives that may open up more avenues for my types of reading I wanted to do. Kobo looked to be the second best in the market but honestly could have went either Clara or Libra and still be content with the purchase. The device is light, portable and feel very nice in my hands in any position. Gotta make sure that if I plan to be looking at this thing for hours that it'll be useable in different orientations without much stress. I do plan to check out more of the audiobook / Bluetooth and their bookstore functionality in the future so can't comment on much there for now.The one thing that also brought me to Kobo was that fact of how easy it was to get KOReader on it as an additional option for reading other types of file types. Now this isn't required at all to have a great experience, but i've used KOReader in the past and so i'm used to it but plan to try and switch between the default reader and KOReader to see what I like the most.Have KOReader is also nice as I can use OPDS to connect to my Calibre Web server I have hosted to grab new books whenever im ready for them.The only thing, if I had to be picky, is that the touch screen can be alittle fickle at times and lag or have some type oh ghosting but I believe that was due to being fresh out of the book as I haven't noticed much of that since.Already spend the last few nights really diving into this device, and as I said before, really happy with the purchase. If you're in a similar situation or mindset like I was/am I believe you'll love this purchase as well.",
Christian G.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of money amazon scammed me,"I bought this thing, it arrives and I started the device and it crashed, I waste able to restart it, or anything then I sent it back using my own money become Amazon says they will refund me the cost of it, well they do not refund me anything they bacially robbed me, thanks Amazon",
Neighner,4.0 out of 5 stars,Can't use subscription services,"I ended up returning this because I could not use Kindle Unlimited or Scribd with it. And apparently their Kobo Plus subscription is not available in the U.S. Otherwise it's a great device.  I ended up getting an Onyx Boox Leaf 2 instead on Target's website using their store *debit* card for 5% off. The white version is what I got because it has a sunken screen which makes the text sharper. It is an Android e-reader, still e-ink, that has the ability to download the Play Store so I can use Audible, Kindle Unlimited, and Scribd on it. Or whatever app you want to download.",
J. LORENZO BORRAS,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great e-reader for EPUB format,"Great e-reader. Went from a Nook that was losing battery power by the day. So far this Kobo is way better. It’s not only that it has an extra inch in size, but it is easier to handle and to turn the pages. Very pleased so far.",
Andrew,5.0 out of 5 stars,A great e-reader that's a pleasure to use!,"Kindle library books aren't available on this device, but .acsm and .epub files are supported natively and Kobo has their own store for ebooks. The integration of Overdrive makes borrowing library books a seamless process. As for the hardware, the e-reader is comfortable to hold and has snappy buttons that makes turning pages a joy. I would definitely recommend this device to anyone interested in getting an e-reader outside of the Kindle ecosystem.",
Luis Alberto Perez piña,5.0 out of 5 stars,Let them buy it without fear.,I like that the battery lasts a long time and I can put the letters in any size.

kerbe,5.0 out of 5 stars,An excellent e-reader!,"This is my second Kobo device and I'm very pleased: The screen quality is magnificent and the battery life is out of this world. I love that this device doesn't restrict me to one ""bookstore"" and that I can side-load e-books that I already own or use it to read e-books that I've made, myself.Would I prefer a slightly larger screen (like my previous Kobo)? Yes. Is this screen too small? No. Do I prefer buttons to touch-screen? No. Do the buttons work well? Yes. Does the touch-screen work well? Yes. Do you need both buttons and touch-screen? No. Will I continue to purchase Kobo e-readers? YES!",
Miguel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent! It's a joy to read!,"The settings are easy to use to make reading easy in all kinds of lighting. The black letters are crisp and stand out well. Syncs and updates easily with OverDrive & Libby. Easy one-hand operation. Only con so far is when reading in the dark I set refresh screen to every 10 pages. Wish I could turn off refreshes in the dark. Otherwise better experience than the 3 year old Kindle. The slightly larger screen is nice. Had I realized the size value I would have purchased the Kobo Sage 8 inch. Even so, the Kobo 2 physical page up/down are just perfect (except for the little click with each push). It's so easy to turn a page with my thumb without moving my hand or using my other hand. I really appreciate that!",
Oregon Aeronaught,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good upgrade,"Well, being as how my Kobo H20 eventually failed after 3-4 years, I like this upgrade very much and it seems to connect faster.  Battery seems good, but the slight upgrade is not much of a change.  Do spring for the Kobo cover....I tried three 'aftermarket' covers and sent them all back as the stand was too flimsy.  Be nice if Kobo had a better selection of 'fabric' and color for the covers.",
carol lubecki,1.0 out of 5 stars,Back to paper books. This showed me ereader is not ready for primetime.,"Works great when it works. i got this for library books only.Dislike:*missing books from the library's catalog (e.g. things i have taken out on libby do not appear on the kobo).*buggy. sometimes typing is incredibly frustating. it'll interpret my figure tap as several different keys all over the key pad.*sometimes it synchs with overdrive. sometimes it wont. no idea what to do. wait? come back in a few days? very frustrating. i think i'll get rid of it instead.*its kinda annoying how this is set up to push you towards for the kobo store. why do i have to log into walmarts website to set this up? i'm not going to buy books. i go this for the library books only.  but i have to jump through hoops to get there!Likes*good battery power.*i did like the e-reader reading experience more than i thought i would.*way better than reading on a tablet! easier on the eyesConclusion: this is not for me. i gave the ereader a try. back to books for me! i'll check back in a few years hopefully they will figure out how to make this technology work. the concept is promising, but its a clunky buggy piece of hardware that trys to push you to buy books from them.WARNING: amazon won't let you return this. it started acting buggy now and its too late to return. so be careful.",

Called kobo customer service kept being put on hold and all they did is keep telling me to go items I already did.  Then they offered a replacement but then kept losing phone connection.Great to connect with library book but otherwise product not worth the money. Will return.

Freda Powell,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,"I really like the size. My hands get arthritic some days and this reader is the perfect size to hold. Larger than a cell phone, smaller than a hard cover book. VERY light weight with out a cover. It's the cover that makes it feel just a tad heavy. I can choose font, font size, brightness, and button management and a couple of other features I'm not sure how to use but overall a great product.",
Melody,1.0 out of 5 stars,Freezes all the time,The kindle is a much better ereader.,
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Kobo vs Kindle, kobo is the winner!","I have had kindle ereaders for years.  My latest kindle was the 2021 paperwhite. I did not like that it lacked page turn buttons, the home screen was horrible with it's book advertising, I found it hard to hold, and the entire operating system was difficult for me to navigate.The Kobo libra 2 solves all of those problems. The operating system is so easy to navigate.  I love the ease of holding it, the page buttons and it's automatic rotating screen. Those features help make long reading sessions much more comfortable. The home screen is beautifully organized. The screen shows only the information I want to see and is not a cluttered mess.  The overdrive feature is simply AMAZING and makes this 100 times better than the kindle. It is easy to use and saves me money on books.  I utilize my library like never before. I have heard of complaints that the kobo store doesn't have as many books available, I have not found a single book that I have wanted unavailable.  The prices of books in the store are similar to Amazon. This uses a USB-c charger (unlike the kindle oasis).  It is cheaper than the kindle oasis (the nearest equivalent kindle with buttons).Kobo does have a couple of shortcomings. It does ghost at times.  The battery power doesn't last as long as the kindle, but I have only used it with the wi-fi on. I'm not a fan of the fonts that are available, but I know that you can side load fonts.  I have not tried that yet. I would not say the fonts are horrible either, perhaps I've used a kindle for so long I am just used to those fonts.  I feel like the plastic cover/case could be upgraded as well.The Kobo is not perfect, but it is leaps and bounds better than the kindle. The overdrive feature, the home screen, and the easy to navigate operating system really is amazing. Kindle (at this time) doesn't compare at all.  I can't imagine going back.",
JoJo,2.0 out of 5 stars,Nice Product/Expensive Books,"Love the feel and use of the Kobo however, the price of books compared to Amazon are $3.00 to $6.00 higher.  Based on that, I will never purchase again.",
David,1.0 out of 5 stars,Arrived with several dead pixels and Customer Service did nothing,"The product arrived with some random pixels that are always white and they don't get black no matter what. I contacted customer service as soon as I could to let them know this and they did NOTHING, but insisted in having me ship the reader back. I told him that I could not, as I'm not currently in the US and not planning to return in a while. Also, shipping the item back from where I am would be more expensive than just get a new one, and he did not listened to me and just said ""then contact Kobo directly"". I know some of you would say ""then just get a new one"", but I'm stating here the fact that I got no resolution from this company.I purchased the reader from you, so the answer must come from you, don't you think? I'm really disappointed, and don't get me wrong. The Libra 2 is an amazing reader, but the damaged unit that I got and the awful customer service... I'm never buying again from this company BlueProton.",
Some Way,1.0 out of 5 stars,Only Audio Books--that are purchased from  KOBO will Function---No other Audio books work,"Purchased Clara 2E as upgrade as it also has Audio---Wireless feature.When I tried loading  Audio books from the Library --they would not download.Contacted Koko and they said-- Only audio books purchased at  Kobo can be heard on a  Clara 2E device. Kobo devices will only play in Audio from books are Purchased from Kobo. ( No exceptions)That information should be clearly printed on the outside of their packaging. "" Audio books only function when purchased from Kobo-- without Exception.'So I now download Audio books from the Library and listen to them by Bluetooth from my Phone.The Clara 2E was a wasted purchase as I already had a fully functioning eReader for text.",

That Guy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For reading e-books, there's _nothing_ better","The Libra 2 hits a sweet spot in Kobo's development path of incremental hardware upgrades from the already outstanding Aura HD.  It has a perfect size and form factor, is lighter, and has a glorious screen. Except for some unneeded gimmicks on the home screen, the software works just right.  Sideloading is straightforward and uncompromised.With how much I love reading, I would gladly pay for the best product on the market at any price point.  This is the one.",

I like it better much better than Kindle, even though that maybe supposably developed more in some ways, but this one just does more it seems as you would expect, it’s very intuitive for this kind of reader it’s obviously not worse than a Kindle. I like it much better than the kindle but I didn’t have a kindle with the page turn buttons like the Oasis or something yet so I can’t speak about those, but as far as the paperweight  is concerned this one’s great…",
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,impossible to set up,I've spent 5 hours trying to set this thing up and have given up! It's going back to the amazon junk pile tomorrow. I don't know if it is defective but it won't connect to the internet even though it shows up on my network. The Kobo program I downloaded for my desktop had me create an account and now won't allow me to access it! What a piece of junk!,
Jannike Johnsen,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Difficult to use, may have gotten a lemon","The good:I love this device. The book is easy to hold, love the fact that there're no ads, power button is in a good spot, love the lighting, it's easy on the eyes, love that I can turn the page by clicking a button.I was able to get the books I had on Calibre that are in epub format loaded on to this device. I was able to sync books that were free from the Kobo store. These are the books I have been reading.The bad:There were no instructions that came with the device. It was trial and error and pushing a bunch of buttons and a long time spent trying to get Calibre and kobo dot com to all sync up since there were no instructions and I am no tech genius.I got this device for 2 reasons. 1. I wanted to not give any more money to Amazon than I needed to (even though I purchased it on here, but I was thinking books, etc). I also like the fact that it had imbedded overdrive so I could check out books, no ads, a button to turn pages instead of swiping, it came with a charger, and this ereader uses epub format so I could download books from other sources. 2. I love reading and have a millions books and am running out of places to store them so I am donating a bunch. I wanted to use overdrive and utilize my library instead of buying books.The problem is that even though I have been on overdrive on my laptop and borrowed books, I can't get the books onto the device. It doesn't sync to overdrive when I am on overdrive, or through the Kobo dot come website. The overdrive on the reader goes in an endless loop, having me input my library card information and pin number over and over again. I have tried signing in with the other options on there including google, using my phone number and the endless loop continues. I called customer support, which was less than helpful, the person was half asleep. I looked on the user guide for my device, also not helpful. If I can't use it for the purpose I spent all this money on, and can't get the support I need to get this dang thing to work, than it is a gigantic paperweight once I have read the few books I have on there and that is why it got 1 star. So I am going to return it and buy the kindle I was trying to avoid buying.",
Howard Co,4.0 out of 5 stars,Value for money  e-reader,Love it so far. A little slow on the PDF reading  but overall a wonderful product!,
Glub-Glub,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great, except for audio","I purchased this item, because I thought that it would be handy to be able to listen to audiobook, or to read the ebook. As a reader, this item is really quite good, and if that is what you want, it’s just fine. The reader is light and the letters are crisp. A bit of caution is that using the back light reduces the battery life, but that’s not too surprising .On the other hand, the audio function is a disaster. I downloaded a three audiobook set. Jumping to book 3, chapter 22 was so slow that I gave up. Actually, I’m not sure that it worked or can do that. My feeling is that the processed is not up to the task. You’re much better listening to an audiobook on a cell phone or a tablet.Moreover, a subscription for Kobo audio books is currently $9.95 a month and that’s not worth it wifi sluggish performance.A final issue is that the audio books and the ebooks do not automatically synchronize.",
Jon Turner,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A little larger than I thought, but still a great purchase","I was between this and the Kindle Paperwhite, but I’m happy that I got this one. The buttons on the side make it much easier for me to read one-handed, and it’s light so that helps too.Edit: This size is actually fantastic. You can also zoom in the text so it fits the size better, which makes reading comfortable! It’s a nice ergonomic shape so reading is convenient.",
JFin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Switching from Kindle,"Sorry Amazon. I am loving my new Kobo Libra 2. I have owned four Kindles in the past and they always seemed to have something lacking for me. I have the latest Kindle Paperwhite but somehow the touchscreen was at times either too sensitive or not sensitive enough and I got frustrated. I went back to using my ancient Kindle Keyboard since I liked the buttons for page turning but it was not backlit. I considered the Oasis but got so turned off by the cost, the mini USB and the extra $20 for no ads. I had heard about the Kobo Libra 2 and decided to try it when it was on sale.  Since I borrow e-books from the library a lot, it is so easy now. Love the page turn buttons and even the touch screen functions are not frustrating. Glad I made the purchase.",
Niko Artley,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,"I love that it has physical page-turn buttons. The slight angle of the bit you hold is very nice, it gives easier access to the buttons and feels more like holding a book. Battery lasts a long time, and does not drain fast on standby. Sometimes the screen ""ghosts"" a little bit, but it clears up pretty quick.",
Katherin Marquez,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best purchase of the year,"I waited until Black Friday to buy my Kobo, because I thought the original was a bit steep. Now I think of something happened to mine, I'd immediately buy it again. Full price. It is THAT good. I don't even think I need to worry because it's very sturdy, and I purchased a case to keep it in my bag.The Kobo is amazing, the text is pristine and crisp, and it's so comfortable to hold. The buttons are very convenient, too, especially knowing that other brands who offer them, do it for a lot more money. I think the Kobo is currently the best option when it comes to ereaders, so it's worth every penny.Edit: it's been over a month and I'm still in love! I was swayed by the 7' screen and the fact that it's waterproof. I have pretty small hands (I'm 4'11''), so I was worried it'd be too big and uncomfortable to carry everywhere, but it's really not! It somehow looks bigger in pictures, but it's about the size of a paperback, only a little wider. It is pretty lightweight and I can read while holding it with one hand. You can switch up the button commands very easily, I do it a lot when going from holding with one hand to the other.As I said, I have freakishly small hands and I've had no issues so far, I think the size and weight are perfect! The only thing is that the cover does add some weight. I don't know how well they fare with bumps and being dropped (mine feels very sturdy but I worry about damaging the screen), but I keep mine in its case when I'm not using it because of the weight, and luckily I haven't dropped it over since I got it!It's been a joy to have it. I really think you should go ahead and take the plunge!",

Michael Kinder,4.0 out of 5 stars,My preferred eReader,"Bought the Libra 2 to compare to the 2021 Kindle Paperwhite (PW).Pros:- Fast response: page turns often have no delay compared to 2021 PW- Format friendly: accepts more file types than Kindle does. Sideloaded a comic book that didn’t need reformated and reads flawlessly. Kindle forced the file to change file types and does not look as clean.- Buttons are great: the buttons are large enough and placed well that it is easy to change pages without adjusting my grip. Don’t want to use buttons? No problem!- Hold it however you want: hand getting tired? Flip the device around and hold it in your other hand. Or set it down in landscape mode. The screen and buttons will adjust to whatever orientation you need.- Read anytime: the screen’s brightness and warmth settings are crisp. Adjusting the brightness by sliding along the screen edge is intuitive and fast.Cons:- Dark mode: the PW has a quick and simple process for activating dark mode for nighttime reading. the Libra 2 is less intuitive. It should be an option under the brightness setting, but instead it’s on the second page of the general settings menu.- Gyro is hyperactive: sometimes just by tilting the device a little too far will cause the screen to autorotate. It can be a pain getting it to readjust to fit the orientation sometimes needing the device to be twisted different orientations before it finally responds. Note: there is an option to turn off autorotate.- Less desirable case: the official folding case does not work well as a stand. Because Kobo is not as popular as Kindle, the availability of third party alternatives is not as robust.",
Irish,5.0 out of 5 stars,EVERY deity's gift to bookworms!,"I love books. The feel, the smell, nothing beats opening a new book or rereading a beloved favorite for the twentieth time. However, books are heavy, and they take up a ton of space, which comes at a premium when you don't live in the local library/aren't allowed to line every wall with bookshelves by the significant other to make your place feel like a library.Enter ebooks. Yes, I know audio books are a thing and possibly even easier to use, but I read much faster than I listen, and even speeding up the reading I can finish multiple books in the time it would take to listen to the first audio book. So I started reading ebooks on my laptop, and moved to my tablet and phone. It was meh at best, and annoying to always have to drag a power cord for charging everywhere I went. It's also terrible for your eyes. But e-readers were barely better than the tablets, until e-ink technology arrived. But I still held off, until I finally started doing my research at the beginning of the year. Kindle seemed the only real choice, but I already had thousands of ebooks and it seemed a daunting task to figure out how to load them to a Kindle properly, and the thought of paying for a device that came with ads unless I paid even more just made me angry.So I bought a Kobo. And I fell in love. I've been using my Kobo for months, dragging it to work, on planes, to the beach, out to the pool, the local parks, on road trips, to doctor's offices, basically everywhere I go it's in my purse. The screen is easy to read in the brightest sunlight and the darkest nights when I can't sleep without finishing just one more chapter at barely 5% brightness, and the night mode makes the screen comfortably warm so the blue light doesn't bother me. I can easily get a week or more of reading between charges with the wifi turned off, and adding my own books from outside sources is a piece of cake. I can't speak for the audio book usability, but I have hundreds of books on my device with barely a dent in the available memory, and borrowing books from the library with Overdrive is a snap.The feel of the reader isn't a book, but it still feels solid without being heavy or awkward, and I love the buttons for turning the pages rather than being entirely touchscreen. The USB C also makes it easier to charge as most of my other electronics use the same type of cable.The only hiccup is in adding books from Barnes and Noble, as their file type is essentially unusable with anything not running their Nook software, but there are workarounds for everything.The magnetic screen off and on with the case I bought from Amazon is also great because I can close my book at any time without needing to find a bookmark or remember a page number.  I can also skip between books to my heart's content and I never need to worry about losing my place because the reader remembers where I am in every book!If you're on the fence about getting an e-reader for reading books, this is the one to try. If you want something that can also browse the internet or have multiple apps, buy a tablet. This thing is solid as a rock for the serious reader. You won't regret it!",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great upgrade!,"I haven't had it long enough to rate the battery, but I'm sure it will last a long time like the Libra H20 that I have. This was on sale so I upgraded, and I am so happy that I did! The lighting is the main difference I see.  And wow is that nice! I did test out the Bluetooth with an audible sample and that works great, though I doubt I will use it, but ya never know. I do use pocket for articles, I did on my H20. Glad that's still there.  Its just a great reading experience and I am happy that I upgraded 😊",
Gina L.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Overdrive,"I bought this device mainly for borrowing library books. I'm a little disappointed. It connects to my overdrive account but appears to only allow you to use one library at a time? I have four libraries in my overdrive because they don't all have the same books. Someone here said you can log in and out putting your various library credentials in. What a pain. Also, I can access overdrive through the discover page and searching the Kobo store. But so far hitting ""borrow books from your library"" does not work for me. Smaller issues. Does not come with a user manual. It has two fairly useless papers in the box. The quick start guide says to turn on and charge. And the other paperwork is a battery warning and tells you to read the user guide, which isn't included. It is online.",
Brandon Kennedy,4.0 out of 5 stars,UPDATE: OverDrive integration now works,"UPDATE, Dec 2022: Upping my rating from two to four stars because the OverDrive-totally-not-working issue has been solved. I know because I ended up buying another one after returning the first in frustration. As others have noted, OverDrive still doesn't work very well when you have cards at multiple libraries. That aside, the device itself is a pleasure to read on, and if you manage your collection in Calibre, your 'Collections' categories transfer nicely to the Kobo.ORIGINAL:I really wanted to like this Kobo, but after hours of troubleshooting, the OverDrive integration still wouldn't work. Ease of use in borrowing library books was a key selling feature and a primary use for me, so I unfortunately had to return it.Pros: lightweight; comfortable; sharp screen with bright, even lightingCons: OverDrive integration is broken; interface can feel sluggish",
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent product, super recommended","The size is perfect, the buttons are quiet (they make very little noise), the light can range from the dimmest to the brightest.",
Kathleen Kelleher,1.0 out of 5 stars,not worth it if you want to use your library card,"after an initial few months of using and loving my ereader, I am through with it. Overdrive won't sync or even load on the app, which leaves you with an option only to buy books. I bought this to intentionally use with overdrive, but the feature is dead. Don't buy it, just buy a kindle.",
N,1.0 out of 5 stars,Poor customer support,If I could give this zero stars I would. Their customer support is awful and my kobo is useless after a year. Buy a kindle instead,
