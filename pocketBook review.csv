Sharon Freelon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Well....,"So disappointed! I wanted a smaller eReader and this size was perfect.. Such a chore to load books, a process that I consistently failed to achieve. I found I had to use wifi and online reading apps to enjoy my books. Battery charge didn't last as long as I expected, and could only be charged via USB connected to a computer. I would have returned but I wasted too much time trying to get it to work. Sorry, but I'm not impressed.",,,,
Duckfeet,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for backpacking entertainment,"Update: recent update fixed the glitch and it works great now.I took this along for some evening tent time entertainment while backpacking for 2 weeks. It held up wonderfully in my pack - including several days of thunderstorms. No damage. The brightness levels were perfect. This is also the perfect lightweight size. I was able to buy some ebooks from Google books and load them on here quickly by sending them over an email link. I bought this in open box for under $100. There seems to be a bit of glitchiness when swiping to turn the page, but actually turns it back some pages (hence 4 stars) but otherwise I'm glad I chose this over the Kindle.",,,,
Rachel Drenning,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best eReader ever,"I have tried every Kindle, Book, Kobo, etc. and these eReaders win, every time. I absolutely love this one. Just pre-ordered the new Kindle Paperwhite 11 a few weeks ago but going to cancel and order a Pocketbook Inkpad Pro 3.",,,,
powerglide,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good,"Good device, unfortunately reacts a bit sluggishly. But I don't know any comparison/competing products. Pocketbook's in-house eBook shop is rather modest",,,,
Salvador Congost Luengo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Magnificent ebook,A good second-hand purchase.,,,,
David del Valle Laveaga,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent purchase,"Super, the device doesn't hurt my eyes, it allows me to read in conditions where a normal tablet can't. It's almost not heavy",,,,
Alexis RENARD,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect?,"The screen is very readable thanks to its high resolution, the texts are not “pixelated” which really gives us the impression of being in front of a page of a book. We have many options to adapt the brightness of the screen to the environment, whether it is managed automatically or not. Also, the heat of the screen is adjustable and it is very practical to read at night without disturbing our sleep with the blue light (personally I set the heat of the screen to 100%, it feels a little “orange”, but you get used to it quickly) Very good autonomy, after 4 hours of reading, I still have 90% battery left with a brightness average. Very light, it is pleasant to hold in the hand, but because of its screen width, I am thinking of taking a case with the small strap on the back to hold it even more easily in one hand. You can import books and other files to integrate into the e-reader system (dictionaries for example) from your PC to the “PocketBookCloud”, it's very easy to do. Otherwise you can transfer the files to the e-reader directly by USB connection from your pc, as simply as on a USB key. Navigating through the different sections of the e-reader, as well as through the books, is easy, either through the physical buttons at the bottom of the device, or by touch. A micro USB/3.5mm jack cable allows us to connect headphones and enjoy music that we have recorded in The only downside that I would bring to this e-reader is the annoying lack of responsiveness of the screen, especially when you are used to the velocity of those of smartphones, but nothing disturbing once you are immersed in a book, that's the most important thing.",,,,
Muffy 12,3.0 out of 5 stars,Short lifespan,"After just under two years, the device completely gives up the ghost, despite gentle treatment. Unable to charge Too expensive for the short period of use.",,,,
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the price.,I bought it for my wife almost two years ago.It still works but sometimes it freezes not often of course. It is light and easy tu use. She is recommending it .,,,,
CNeumannSG,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good reader with errors,"The technical specifications of Touch HD 3 are impressive: 300PPI display with Smartlight, 16GB memory, water protection, Bluetooth and scroll buttons. And all this at a weight of only 155g. Not to mention the numerous eBook, audio and image formats that the device supports. Fantastic.And in fact, the first impression is very good. Small, light, pretty to look at. Very sharp text representation. If you also give the reader a suitable cover, (I chose the recommended “Lines” cover by Pocketbook), it fits well in the hand despite its small dimensions. The initial setup with firmware update is also done quickly and comfortably... but then quietly disillusionment follows.The scroll buttons are not perfectly fitted and wiggle like a child's rocker. The display is well lit but not perfect. At the bottom it is noticeably darker than at the top. A look at the Tolino Shine 3 or Kobo Clara shows how well you can illuminate 6"" displays with Smartlight. But since all displays of these readers come from the same manufacturer, it must be due to the control of the LEDs that the Pocketbook is visibly inferior to the competition.The reading software of the Touch HD 3 is pre-inflood. Page margins, line spacing and font sizes can only be set in very rough steps. And it's not even possible to select Justification as text alignment. So if you buy a left-aligned book, e.g. from Bastei, then it stays on the Pocketbook with this formatting. Even Tolinos and Kindles can do that much better.Anyway, the software: At Pocketbook I always had the impression that new firmware versions are never checked for their core functions. You can now freely select and move the pictograms on the homepage (which is really cool), but apparently one of the developers never tries to read a book on the device. Otherwise, I cannot explain it to myself, for example, that with the new Touch Lux 5 it was not possible to use the chapters of a book. Clicking on any chapter in the table of contents resulted in immediate closing of the book. Apparently, anyone just never tried that.However, you have to let Pocketbook publish bug fixes quickly in such cases. In this respect, Ukraine seems to be much more flexible than Kindle or Kobo/Tolino. But it would be even nicer if these constant bug fixes were not necessary at all. If just a new firmware came on the market, where everything works and not some old problem is eliminated, while creating two new ones at the same time.Fortunately, the Pocketbook firmware allows the installation of additional reading software. Both from the Coolreader I use and from the Koreader there are very useful variants for Pocketbook. These programs can be set up very individually and work without errors, but do not support copy-protected books, such as they can be obtained from the eLibrary.So how to rate Touch HD 3? In principle, very good hardware, which, however, has weaknesses in the scroll buttons of my model and in the illumination. For this there is a star deduction in total.The software can also do much on paper that you would not expect from an eBook reader: from chess to sodoku, from music players to RSS messages, from a Dropbox connection to your own cloud. Class. But Pocketbook stumbles in the core competence of a reader: The reading software, whether Epub2 or Epub3 reader, is very weak and little up-to-date. That costs another star.So remain good three stars for an eBook reader who wants to do everything but still has some weaknesses. Of course, the extensive data sheet makes an impression on the “testers” of computer stupid, but a user who actually reads books with Touch HD 3 quickly notices that hardware and software are not perfect.",,,,
Miguel Angel,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good e-book reader with fair quality of materials,"It looks great, easy to configure and use, it can be synchronized with the PocketBook website so that you can have your books on several devices synchronized. The quality of the materials is fair, in any case it has already fallen off a few times and the screen has held up perfectly, not so the plastic cover that has been lifted at some point, I suppose that some inner tab has broken.",,,,
P Stéphane,3.0 out of 5 stars,Worse than the previous generation,"I'm used to this range. Now I am disappointed. Under the pretext of a larger memory, it is not possible to put a micro-SD card. And the battery drains faster even without using the light",,,,
Pefo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great ebook reader,"After having been annoyed with various Tolinos for years because they have bad software and crashed countless times, I finally decided to change brands. Tolino is really the last scrap, incomprehensible how the good reviews come together. Now for the Touch Hd 3. The first impression: It looks very good. Very slim and good to touch The software and menu is a different league compared to Tolino. Nothing is missing and everything works great. The setting options are really in a class of their own. Good, he reacts a bit sluggish sometimes, but that's whining at a high level. The illumination of the screen is perfectly fine, I don't see any halos there. It's bright enough too. The mechanical buttons are also great, you can even configure them yourself, what more could you want. The only negative thing I can think of is the on/off button. It is a bit small and difficult to operate, there is still room for improvement. The most important thing is that it has now never crashed after almost a month. All in all, a super reader that I can fully recommend. Get your hands off the Tolino junk! After 4 months of use, the coating will come off on the edge after a holiday on the beach. And decent! Of course, something like that shouldn't happen at all, device has been sent in.",,,,
ClausVonDerKueste,4.0 out of 5 stars,"small, economical and practical, but also a little slow","I use the HD3 to read scientific literature in PDF form. Often there are also two-column PDFs with small fonts. It is possible to make the font enlarged and easy to read by appropriate settings (turning off the free border, sequencing the columns, turning). Naturally, however, you have to let the reading detail wander back and forth like a magnifying glass. To do this, there are two arrow keys or a swipe panel on the touchscreen.Some PDFs do not work. Especially bad I take the manufacturer that the arrow keys for navigation let me down! One is more engaged in the fumbling operation than reading the text.Reading books is a little more straightforward. After a few weeks of intensive use, I made my peace with the HD3. Positive are the low power consumption, the automatic marking of the current reading point in the book and the wonderful synchronization with the Dropbox folder of other IT devices.Overall, the processor is expected to be faster and the operating system is more stable. Then I would also like to invest a few euros more for such an upgraded device.",,,,
egpet,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good in tests, unreliable when reading books from the ONLEIHE library","If it works, touch HD3 for purchased ebooks is a good device. However, I mostly read eBooks from the ONLEIHE library on HD3 and bought it because it was included in the list of suitable devices for the ONLEIHE. In addition, the relevant test results were all good in various media.Unfortunately, I can't join this.After about 4 months the first repair because the HD3 reported hard drive errors and could not find its Adobe ID despite successful initialization. I couldn't read a book.After a successful repair, everything was ok for 2 months, then again the Adobe ID was not found. No book was readable. After several hours of debugging and internal memory formatting, everything went again. But all the books, of course, were in data nirvana (I know backup!).Now, again a few weeks later, the same game. reformatting and it went back hours later.This is something you can do at home as a retirees, but what is it like in the middle of your vacation far away from your home PC or as a professional with little free time.My Facit: The device isonly partially usable for reading ONLEIHE books due to the frequent ID loss. I'm not enjoying it anymore, I should have listened to friends and bought a Tolino reader. They didn't know my problems.I'm sorry to have bought the Pocketbbok Touch HD3 and will replace it at the earliest opportunity.A pocketbook device will not be.Edit 27.01.2010I still have the device, at the moment it works fine.However, the browser is completely inappropriate. The operation is extremely rudimentary, the character set of thekeyboard is completely inappropriate (/missing, - missing). The browser works at an extreme snail's pace with anextremely poor page display. From my point of view, it's an insolence to sell such softwarefor money.For me one more reason not to recommend this device.,",,,,
WJ,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great e-reader with some glitches,"This review was written after approximately one year of use. In itself, this e-reader is sufficient and books from the library, for example, are easy to set up here (via a small detour). Unfortunately, the reader also has some flaws: * the on button is rather small * after a while, the top layer started to flake (see pictures) * during our last vacation, the on button reacted badly again (this had happened before) and it sometimes took a few minutes before it responded and could be read. I had no idea that the e-reader had become too hot because once back on, it was easy to read again. There is nothing but praise about Amazon's service at this point.",,,,

Eka,1.0 out of 5 stars,"After 5 days, display burnt on","That was my second pocket book, they both had the same error, after a few days the display is broken, the last display is burnt in and there are only stripes. I can't recommend it. You can be unlucky once, but twice it's not a good product.",,,,
G. M.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Battery broken after 3 years,"Great to handle. Unfortunately, the battery is broken after just 3 years",,,,
María G,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best,"I really think this is the best reader there is, you can put light on them and you can make it warm (I prefer to always have its light turned off), you can turn the reader and read horizontally. I haven't had any quarrels with format compatibility. I don't use the app on my cell phone, though, I don't use it because the joke was not reading anymore on my cell phone, so I don't give it much thought. It's comfortable, lightweight, easy to read even with the small font size (yes, you can also adjust the font size), the battery lasts a lot seriously, it took me a month to charge it and I open it daily. Oh, if I suggest you buy the cover ;-)",,,,
Peter Orth,4.0 out of 5 stars,Meets my expectations.,The device has replaced my 8-year-old Kobo and works great.,,,,
Maggus,1.0 out of 5 stars,Development is lagging behind. HD3 reader and pocketbook shop not mature.,"I have the reader from Pockbook the Touch-HD3 model in use now for less than a year. Overall, I can't recommend this reader or the shop either. I've sold it at a great loss now. (I used the Tolino HD2 before) Although I used an original leather pocketbook case, the reader rarely went into sleep mode automatically after it was folded. The reader is very slow to input via the touch screen. The manual buttons under the screen are arranged in a row and therefore indistinguishable in dark environments and thus useless in the dark. After waking up from sleep mode, not only by unfolding the case, but by pressing the power button, the last page read is no longer visible but (uncontrolled number of pages) some book pages before it. Scrolling through the touchscreen does not always work. Scrolling backwards a few times, but pushed forward. Marking texts is like a game of chance and is not to be used. It is only possible to look up and translate foreign words via an active Wi-Fi connection and is very complicated if you want to mark the word. Unusual eBooks cannot be found in the PocketBook shop. Once you've found a book, recessions are hardly present. However, the employees of the pocketbook hotline do not always try to understand due to the Eastern European accent. I'm aware that the company hasn't existed on the market for long. However, the eReaders are also offered at ambitious prices. Where Stiftung Warentest's great test results come from is a mystery to me too! Battery life is ok due to the relatively large battery. I did not use the function as an audiobook. The games aren't fun due to the sluggish screen reactions. I personally have now bought a TOLINO Vision 5 from THALIA and am very happy with it. It's mature!",,,,
clientToulouse,5.0 out of 5 stars,excellent pocketbook,"I have various models of pocketbook (626 and 840), no mystery I like this brand, and yes my opinion is so biased...No surprise, compared to previous generations the eReader is more responsive, the possibility of altering the color temperature of the lighting is a big plus (which I would not have believed before using it). It is more compact than older generation equivalent models, for exactly the same screen size.For my part, I do not use book buying solutions from the e-reader, unlike what is offered with a rebranded Vivlio pocketbook. I do from my PC and I transfer. I understand that might put some of them off.The advantage of using a pocketbook firmware (which is quite possible with Tea/Vivlio) is that there are more updates, but it remains anecdotal. In its version 6, it adds “widgets” on the home screen very shop-orientated/share opinions, but fortunately, we can remove them by going through the options.The binaries produced for older versions (pbterm, etc.) are compatible and still work very well.If I had to issue a review, it would be using a micro-USB port, I would have appreciated a USB-C instead.",,,,
tulpenfee,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great ebook reader... doesn't last long,"I really like this ebook reader. Unfortunately, after less than 3 years, he is now giving up his mind. The touchpad doesn't work properly anymore, it hangs more often now. My old bebook reader from 2012 is still working. Maybe I'm old-fashioned but I'd like to use my devices for at least 5 years longer.",,,,
Bernd Rombach,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great product with teething?,"Great device, super readable screen with adjustable backlighting.16GB of storage is always enough for an entire library.I like the haptics and functionality...All in all a great device, t the way I imagine it and it's fun to read e-books...... But...This thing must have some teething.This is already the second device that can not be turned on after a short time.My partner and I have one each. This was the first and it had worked wonderfully so far... screen remains frozen.Mine couldn't even turn on when it was delivered.The good thing about it is that you get support and the exchange works without problems.I'm hoping for an improved firmware.Therefore only 4 out of 5 stars.",,,,
Emma,4.0 out of 5 stars,It works properly,I have been using it for a few months now and it works well. It's easy to use and I have no problem loading books from my computer. The battery lasts a long time.,,,,
Ingenieur,5.0 out of 5 stars,"At first everything seemed Spanish to me, but now he's doing what he should and more!!","My new one is a good one! Songs came up with the e-book Spanish configured. I tried to find help. That was difficult. After all, I was hoping for help from an obviously bad review. Apparently, my request to contact Amazon was also Spanish. So that's how I started and let me translate Spanish-German online through the initial setup. After completion I was finally able to set German in Spanish!! And everything was good! As new as my e-book is, I'm already thrilled. My first review:“1 starOVERALL RATING IS ONLY FOR CONTACT!!! E-book reader sent is already configured in Spanish. How can I undo and reconfigure the configuration??? I withdraw with this!!",,,,
Tania Scott,5.0 out of 5 stars,An e-book is much better than a paper one!,"My Pocketbook is small and has a screen size of 6 "", which allows me to take it everywhere with me. This book has a backlit screen, which is very important if you read it in the evening or at night. You can also set the size of the text you need on the screen It is also important that you can download a large number of books and a dictionary if you need a translator",,,,
S,1.0 out of 5 stars,Unusable on the First Day,"Highly disappointing first experience. The device malfunctioned on the very first day. Was in the midst of reading a book when I closed the cover (which I bought to go along with it) and set it aside, and the device just never recovered. Was stuck at the start-up screen with little variation despite my troubleshooting with information I could find on the forums, etc. by people who’d experienced similar things with their relevant Pocketbooks.Contacted Pocketbook and after several emails to access the problem and taking their troubleshooting advice, it was deemed that the Pocketbook “is stuck, the display is frozen, and [I] don’t have access to any settings”. Accurately so.I bought it on Amazon since this exact model is not currently available to be shipped into, and nor is it available, in the country I reside in.Even though from reviews Pocketbooks/this model seem to have more potential hard/software issues than its competitors, their privacy policy is by far the best in comparison to any of their competition. This is the reason why I am returning the faulty device back, AND taking a chance by ordering it again when shipping restrictions are lifted (would normally have gotten a straight exchange, but with current delivery restrictions in light of the pandemic, this would have to do).What was not a disappointment in this experience is the customer service for both Pocketbook and Amazon. They were prompt and reasonably helpful in their replies. Will the replacement device be better? Will update if the system allows.",,,,
Marathonia,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great service - gladly again!,"After the reader unfortunately had a display problem within the 24-month warranty period and was no longer usable, I sent it to the service center. Everything was really textbook! Quick communication, friendly communication and quick repair. It was probably a broken display (I can't explain that to myself, but it doesn't matter), which was then repaired as a gesture of goodwill, as this problem occurs more often. In the end, I now have a fully functional device again today and therefore - despite not working after 1.5 years - give it a full 5 stars. A friendly and fast service line is no longer a matter of course these days and I am therefore very satisfied and would buy the device again at any time.",,,,
lili,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pocket library...,"I bought a warehouse deal. The device was like new and had some ebooks and an audiobook from the previous owner on it... The reader runs great, connects perfectly to the Internet and the PC. To get to know all the features, I worked through the PDF tutorial, which I recommend to everyone. I had no complaints. The storage space is limited (there are other PocketBooks with expansion options) that are perfectly sufficient for my purposes. The battery is very long. If you are used to using smartphones, the reaction of the touchscreen seems a little sluggish. This is due to display technology... The display is otherwise excellent, so that reading is still fun after hours. I highly recommend this PocketBook.",,,,
Penelope von Ithaka,3.0 out of 5 stars,Best alternative to Tolino - but broken after 10 months,"I now have the reader two months after being annoyed with Tolino for years. I read a lot with the eLibrary and it works great. Unlike Tolino. The device is easy to use and reading is finally fun again. A purchase recommendation for me. Addendum: After 10 months, the device is suddenly broken. After the usual synchronization, which the device always performs in the middle of reading and then always switches off, it can no longer be switched on. All keyboard shortcuts from the instructions and the forums don't change anything. Connecting to the PC also does not respond. The device goes back. Now I have to search again! I'm annoyed that so often e-readers don't even survive the warranty period. Because I liked the functionality of the reader, including for listening to audiobooks.",,,,
Amazon Kunde,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great E-Reader if you got tired of Kindle,"After many years of using Kindles (Kindle4, Kindle Voyage, Kindle Oasis 2) tried this one and feel very happy now. It’s very flexible, supports huge number of formats, has it’s own built-in ebook shop, allows many ways of sending files to the device. Ergonomics is good, the screen is the same as in any other modern 6” book, backlighting is totally fine. Also it allows installing CoolReader app and I find it perfect for me.",,,,
Ana Conda,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great part,"Over the years, I have 'pre-worked' - from different Sony models to different Tolinos to now the Pocketbook Touch Hd3.The 'waterproof' property was actually trivial for me. Internal memory, compatibility with as many formats as possible and audio capability were crucial. Most competitors flock in one way or another, so the decision was easy for me.I find the eBook properties convincing. Operation by touch screen and/or hardware keys leaves nothing to be desired. The display is sharp and evenly illuminated. Smartlight can be adjusted manually.My only criticism is the integration of dictionaries. Pocketbook uses a proprietary format. Finding, converting, including other dictionaries is tedious and not always successful.A point deduction for it from me.Otherwise clear purchase recommendation.",,,,
EV,4.0 out of 5 stars,Almost perfect,"A really good eBook Reader, which I use almost every day. The memory is with 16 GB more than sufficiently sized, there can easily fit several thousand books on it. The touch screen is sufficiently bright and sharp, only the bottom edge has light shades, but they do not interfere. What really bothers is the sometimes very sluggish reaction of the device. If you press the Home/Menu button, it can take 20-30 seconds for the device to react. Scrolling through the library is also very slow. Here, the manufacturer should repair with a firmware update if necessary. Then the device also deserves 5 stars.",,,,
Clara E,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's very worth it,"The reader is great, lightweight, able to read many formats, intuitive and easy to carry. It's very useful.",,,,
MeBastaAsí,1.0 out of 5 stars,I don't recommend it,"The positive: it's lightweight and much more compatible than Kindle. The downside: I bought it in February, in August it stopped working, I sent it more than 15 days ago and they still haven't refunded me. He's giving me more work than a son.",,,,
Peter,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Top device, screen damage repaired for free","As you can read in other reviews, the device is really great except for a problem that leads to screen damage. As it was fixed quickly and free of charge (unlike other reviews) after around 10 months, there are 4 stars.",,,,
samsaj,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Unfortunately, after 5 months display defective","Since this is my first e-book reader, I can't make comparisons to other devices. I can recommend reading with e-book reader without restriction. I have never read so much before and when literature runs out on weekends or abroad, you can quickly get new ones. With this e-book reader, is a test winner, I would have expected more performance according to today's state of the art and the price. I prefer to order e-books from my bookseller via the computer and then load them via USB to the reader. But now for the 1-point rating. After about 5 months of use, the display is only black in the lower half, so the reader can no longer be used. As of 03.02.2020: A first repair attempt unfortunately went wrong because the service provider offered by Amazon returned the device unrepaired, with the indication that no service is offered for this device... It's just “Made in China”. Warranty processing then went smoothly through Amazon. The device was swapped within one day.",,,,

Amazon Kunde,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good reader with quality deficiencies,"The device sits comfortably in the hand, the screen is very easy to read and it has a useful range of functions. Criticism 1: The PoketBook could have a little more RAM quality: absolutely underground. I bought the device in September 2000 and it had to be replaced in April 2021 because it could no longer be switched on. November 2021 the same thing, the same defect again.",,,,
S. Rosie,3.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely bad.. never again,"I can't understand all the good reviews... or I have a Monday device... I don't read that much yet, so I've been able to live with the very sluggish response time when leafing through the pages so far. The fact that the touch function follows its own laws regarding forward and backward pages... so does what it wants.. and even when reset to factory function continues to show its own incomprehensible will, was somehow still acceptable. However, it is very strange that in recent weeks the battery has only 10 percent within a day with a maximum reading time of 1 hour at a maximum of 1 hour of reading time. However, today's experience knocked out the bottom of the barrel: loaded again overnight... packed at 100% this morning... now I want to read... but nothing happens... punctually after the warranty expired at the end of April... has a funny aftertaste. Until now, this reader has been my choice to borrow books for free from the eLibrary. With all these disadvantages, I'd rather refrain from using it. I bought a Kindle in parallel because of Prime membership... worlds better. Reacts super fast to touch No more pocket buck...",,,,

aust,3.0 out of 5 stars,The technology does not convince me...,"Got an ancient Kindle and thought of a “refresher” because the menu was very slow and I also wanted an “open system”...Due to the positive assessment, I got carried away with the PB... but the device declined because the MMn technology is on the same level as my Kindle from 2012... I have read that unfortunately this is also the case with other providers...Positive: the weight, the processing, the openness!! Negative: just as sluggish menu /operation as my old reader",,,,

Jaime Massana,5.0 out of 5 stars,IDEAL,"I searched among all the models and it would be great that it was 7"", but for the price it has, is the one that offers the most things than the 6"". Everyone speaks wonders and from what little I've had it, it's going to death.

Amazon-Kunde,2.0 out of 5 stars,Expectation not fulfilled,"I have already used several eBook readers (Kindle and tolino). With this, I thought, I'm making a leap forward. After several months of use, unfortunately, I have to say that I do not like it very much. An eBook reader must give me the feeling that I read a book and also offer technical innovations. With Touch HD 3 I expected that. But there are three serious flaws for me:1. It always takes some time for the reader to reload the page after changing the font size or similar. So he's quite slow. But from an eBook reader I expect fast scrolling and brisk page layout, as if I had a book in my hands. 2. The buttons (four) do not make sense. Every time you have to feel (or look, in the dark) whether you have caught the right Browse button. The Browse button would have listened to the side. 3. The feel is very unpleasant. The reader has quite angular to sharp areas. It conveys the feeling of cheap plastic. No pleasant feeling. That wasn't the case with Tolino and Kindle. If I would like to sell, I would want to pass it back quite quickly, albeit with a bad conscience.",,,,
Corvus Corax,5.0 out of 5 stars,“Cool!” in the sense of “very appealing”,"In a comprehensive test report I read: there are no bad eBook readers. Since I already have a few, I would agree with this statement in principle.But I would like to say: This one has some nice features (reading function, music/audiobook player, some nice apps, big memory)... and... oh so, yes it is also very appealing as an eBook reader for my needs.Of course, I could report a lot of bad things right now, but Mom always said not to lie. Good: Then I have nothing but a recommendation.",,,,
Pere,5.0 out of 5 stars,very complete e-reader,"I spent a month analyzing the e-readers available on the market. What if Kindle, Kobo... In the end I stumbled upon Pocketbook and I am very happy. It's lightweight, it can get wet, a high-definition screen, physical buttons, warm white light and compatible with more than 20 formats after the last 16 gigabyte update. Another good thing is the software it has. The brand has updated it to have the latest format compatibility. And finally, it works great with ebiblio. To improve... The material used in the back wears out.",,,,
Kiri,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good e-reader,"I have the reader for 9 months now and I'm quite excited. The battery life is sufficient, with daily use of 2 hours it lasts a good 2 weeks. The brightness is very high. Use it mostly at the lowest brightness levels or have the lighting.",,,,
lw,3.0 out of 5 stars,Attention product not compatible with French catalog,"It is pretty, light, the screen is very nice but-the bluetooth is limited to some type of device-the e-reader to a lot of slow down-no French dictionary-the bookstore is not in FrenchSo very disappointed to have a product that will not work 100% because Pocketbook does not distribute anything for France",,,,
Andreas.Baens@gmx.de,4.0 out of 5 stars,EBUB3 not yet supported,"I like the Ebook Reader very much. But unfortunately, EBUB3 is not supported yet. This should only be done with the next software update. Unfortunately, this is not shown on the website. However ,the hotline of PocketBook is SUPER (honest and very hard)!!!",,,,
tortugita,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great ereader; better than kindle paperwhite,"I already knew the brand and this model has bought it as a gift. I have had many ereader and Kindle models... all case. I like this one much more than those from Amazon because it is lighter, tactile and at the same time with buttons, and light adaptable in warmth. Ah, if like my honorary, you like to make sudokus... you don't separate from the little gig. To all this, I bought it from Amazon Warehouse for 115€. To repeat, with your eyes closed",,,,

Ralf Cordes,3.0 out of 5 stars,56k modem sends greetings,"Does what it should, but the browser in conjunction with the display technology has a 1star speed disaster. Getting books and eLibrary are more of a 1-star expert. If text is on the screen first, then 4 stars.",,,,
MOUREY PATRICK,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent eReader,"I was a paper fan, but the containment coming... it's still more convenient to order books.Perfect for reading ALL ebook formats.Relaxing reading for the eyes, no matter the light.I took it refurbished because the price is a bit high and I ordered another one for my wife.",,,,

Serge W.,2.0 out of 5 stars,Display breaks pretty quickly,"A good month ago I bought the Pocketbook Touch HD 3 Reader because my first reader (PRS-T1) was now retired after several years. As some predecessors have already written, the functions of this ebook reader are not to be criticized. The menus are clear and easy to use. The reading quality is also relatively good. But unfortunately, this reader is not at all durable. Only worn once in a jacket pocket and the display is ready, despite the protective case. This was of course very annoying and now I have to get a new reader (probably no warranty claim). My tip: the Pocketbook Touch HD 3 ebook reader can only be used for home use and this with extreme caution. Please do not put it in a jacket pocket, even if this is shown in their presentation video. Unfortunately, it's misleading. That's why only 2 stars.",,,,
Hugo0815,1.0 out of 5 stars,An absurd,"The e-book stopped operating after 3 days. It is already our second device, but this time I received a Monday device. After 3 days, nothing works anymore. It shows the start screen and nothing else. No button works anymore. If the device is plugged into the charging part, nothing changes. Replaced the power supply and cable with which the other device works, no response here either. The device returns immediately.",,,,
Benitolino,2.0 out of 5 stars,very annoying...,"I was actually satisfied with the handling. Had to exchange the device the second time now because it hung up and can't start again, and all within a year. For me, this is my last attempt with this e-book reader, as I was otherwise very satisfied. It is not an overpriced device, nevertheless something like this should not happen.",,,,

B. S.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad frame finish,"The coating on the frame dissolves after repeated contact and an unsightly, rough area is formed which looks as if swollen and does not feel good to the touch. For me, it's only where I touch - thumbprint, with another e-book in the family, the surface of the entire frame is broken.",,,,
Beatle,2.0 out of 5 stars,Display broken despite protection - no warranty,"Functions of the Ebook Reader are actually quite fine, that you can't transport the Ebook Reader in a handbag without the display breaking is an absolute NOGO for me. Although I transported the ebook reader in a protective case in the purse it broke. The handbag was placed on the front passenger seat only in the car and hung on the chair in the restaurant. In the evening, the displap was broken. Feedback from the customer service is that the display has a mechanical damage and therefore cannot be carried out under the warranty. I have/had a Sony PRT-2, which I have been carrying in my purse for years and I had no problems with the display, obviously the e-reader is not made for use outside the house.",,,,
Helle,5.0 out of 5 stars,e-book reader 'Touch HD 3' by Pocketbook is very good,"Good to use, quick turn. Whether in the left or right hand, turning with your thumb is no problem.

Tony,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good alternative to all Kindle,"Very nice e-reader. Physical buttons on bottom of the book, nice software, eye friendly background light. Software could be upgraded for faster page turn. It replaced my Kindle Oasis 2017 and I'm happy with it. Reads most ebook formats, Pocketbook cloud connection or Dropbox connection. Books could be sent to personal Pocketbook email same as Kindle.",,,,
Christian N.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Defective after less than a year! Stay away!,"The reader was used 2 to 3 times a week for about 1 hour, was always equipped with the latest updates and worked perfectly until yesterday. Now the screen in the upper half is no longer readable. Transverse and longitudinal lines have formed. It looks like pencil marks have been blurred. Resetting the device did not result in any improvement. A lifespan of less than a year is simply unacceptable. Stay away. I myself have been using several versions of the Kindle for a long time and am very happy with them.",,,,
Ruhrpott Jesus,1.0 out of 5 stars,A computer image test winner... that probably says it all,"for expensive money you get an e-reader (my experiences, does not have to apply to everyone)- who has a far too nervous situation senor- whose ambilight is really painful for the eyes in contrast to the Tolino- reacts much too sluggish, despite a fast processor- whose ON/OFF switching is much too fiddly, from this strange flashing if you do not turn it off properly, quite apart - the buttons for turning are much too soft, besides they are very prone to fingertappers - the speech output is a bad joke - the sleep mode is bad until not working at all or the wake function is also available What positive? - Lots of memory- waterproof (but they are all now)- the Audiobook function is quite nice... but for a READER not urgently neededhave disposed of it today and again take my Tolino Vision 4 HD to hand and make a big bow around the pocketbook in the future",,,,

Holm Rudolph,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Caution, pocketbook reader not recommended!","I bought this reader about 1.5 years ago. In the meantime, there were always updates, the device had to be constantly reset, the Wi-Fi connection did not work, etc. Customer service could only help to a limited extent and after several explanations, because many at the other end of the line only understand German broken. In other words, this e-reader really cost me nerves, money and time. In addition, the connection to the regional bookstore did not work as desired, because the e-books can be purchased via the pocketbook shop or through a regional bookstore with connection to Pocketbook. I'm very disappointed with the device. Often the image or the actions on the touchpoint wobbled only with a delay. In sum, I can't recommend the device and pocketbook as a provider. You'd better look for a better device!",,,,

The light was very comfortable and read all kinds of documents, but after 6 months it crashed and I couldn't get it to work again. I gave it back. The problem with this ebook is that it does not have the little hole that other products have to be able to reset them, so if it crashes nothing can be done.",,,,
SiLa,2.0 out of 5 stars,Unfortunately a failure,"Maybe we had a Monday device, but we weren't happy at all. The device has so many dropouts, reacts very slowly, sometimes not at all.

Now we have switched to the competition (Tolino) and are absolutely satisfied.",,,,

Unfortunately, the first device could not be switched on on the 2nd Christmas day. The swap device, unfortunately, does what it wants, turns the screen unintentionally, the touch screen reacts lame, very slowly to the Internet connection, and other bad features. All in all, very dissatisfied with the device. How the device performed so well in the test is a mystery to us.

Jose G.,3.0 out of 5 stars,👎 In the last update of the device I entered the Spanish Manual,"Correct delivery in time and form. The device complies with what it says.
